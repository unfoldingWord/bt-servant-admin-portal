**Demo target**: June 9 — `#spoken @arabic` working end-to-end with the new editor

## Milestones

| Milestone                         | Progress | Status             |
| --------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------ |
| Per-PR ephemeral CF Workers (#83) | 100%     | Shipped 2026-05-07 |
| Epic #72 — Admin Portal Redesign  | ~10%     | In Progress        |

### Per-PR ephemeral CF Workers — Shipped

- [x] Issue filed (#83)
- [x] Implementation (#84) — `deploy-pr.yml` + `cleanup-pr.yml`
- [x] Frank review + P1 fix (`--force` on wrangler delete)
- [x] Merged at `3e8d087`
- [x] Validated end-to-end via #85 deploy + cleanup
- [x] Pattern documented for Ian's adoption in sibling repos

### Epic #72 — Admin Portal Redesign for Response Tuning (In Progress)

This-repo sub-issues:

- [x] **#75** — Markdown editor + TOC component (shipped 2026-05-07, PR #85)
- [ ] #73 — Add Languages tab to admin portal sidebar (depends on #79 + #75)
- [ ] #74 — Pre-load structural heading scaffold for new language documents
- [ ] #76 — Replace six-box mode editor with markdown editor + TOC (depends on #75 + engine #204)
- [ ] #77 — Comment-block syntax in editor (depends on #75; uses Ulysses `%%` + `++…++`)
- [ ] #79 — Languages CRUD API (worker BFF + frontend client)
- [ ] #80 — Define and enforce language-shepherd permissions
- [ ] #81 — Wire test chat to active mode + language selection
- [ ] #82 — Mode data migration (portal side; depends on engine #204)

Engine repo (`unfoldingWord/bt-servant-engine`):

- [ ] #203 — `#<mode> @<language>` trigger syntax (prompt-driven, not regex)
- [ ] #204 — Mode migration Phase 1 (synthesize markdown on GET, tolerate both shapes)
- [ ] #205 — Strip Ulysses-style comments before assembling system prompt

## Session Log

### 2026-05-07 — Project kickoff + per-PR deploys + #75 markdown editor

**Completed:**

- **Repo setup** — `git init` in `/workspace/bt-servant-admin-portal`, added `unfoldingWord` remote, fetched `main`. Migrated Claude state from host to uw-sandbox container.
- **Epic #72 triage** — Read all existing sub-issues (#73–#77), audited the codebase, identified gaps in the Epic's filings, drafted six new sub-issues (Drafts A–F) covering: Languages CRUD API, language-shepherd permissions, test-chat wiring, trigger syntax, mode migration, comment-block stripping.
- **Filed sub-issues** — #79, #80, #81, #82 (this repo); #203, #204, #205 (engine repo). All cross-linked. #82 + #204 paired and gated.
- **Updated #77 + engine #205** — Tim Jore corrected the comment-syntax convention to canonical Ulysses (`%%` paragraph + `++…++` span, not the `&&...&&` originally proposed). Researched against official Ulysses docs (help.ulysses.app), posted findings with provenance on both issues.
- **#83 — Per-PR ephemeral CF Workers** — filed, implemented, reviewed by Frank (P1 caught: `wrangler delete` needs `--force` in CI), fixed, re-reviewed clean, merged at `3e8d087`.
- **#75 — Markdown editor + TOC** — Designed via cowork mockup with frontend-design skill pass ("Outline-as-Index-Page" direction: spine rail + Roman numerals + active-section pin + paper-toned editor surface). Aligned mockup to project tokens (Outfit-only typography, FA Pro convention noted). Lifted into source: parser, types, two components, three hooks, design tokens. Merged at `e347370`.
- **Pattern doc** — Wrote up the per-PR deploy mechanism as a reusable reference for Ian to adopt in sibling repos (engine, data-loaders).

**In Progress:**

- None — both shipped items merged. Next session opens with sub-issue selection from the Epic #72 list above.

**Blockers:**

- None.

**Next Steps:**

- Pick the next Epic #72 sub-issue to start. Most foundational and parallelizable: **#79 (Languages CRUD API)** — design-independent, foundational for #73 + #80. After that, **#76 (replace six-box editor)** is the natural follow-on now that #75 has shipped, but it's gated on engine #204 deploying first.
- Validate engine team progress on #203, #204, #205 before locking the consumer-side work.
- AGENTS.md is untracked (Codex-equivalent of CLAUDE.md, generated locally, not in git). Decide whether to commit, add to `.gitignore`, or leave untracked.
- Consider whether the GitHub Actions workflows are using deprecated Node.js 20 — `actions/checkout@v4`, `actions/setup-node@v4` etc. flagged as deprecated by Sept 2026. Worth a tech-debt issue but not urgent.

## Known Issues

- None

## Architectural Decisions

Track ADRs under `docs/adr/` if/when needed.

Notable decisions made 2026-05-07 (captured here pending ADRs):

- **Ulysses comment syntax** — Mode and language documents use `%%` (paragraph comment) and `++…++` (paired inline span), verbatim Ulysses convention per Tim Jore. Source: [help.ulysses.app](https://help.ulysses.app/en_US/comments-notes-annotations).
- **Per-PR deploy pattern** — Each PR deploys to `bt-servant-admin-portal-pr-<N>`, auto-deleted on close. `wrangler delete --force` is required for non-interactive runs (per Frank review).
- **Trigger-syntax parsing** — `#<mode> @<language>` should be parsed using BT Servant's existing prompt-driven intent classification pattern, not regex (per Ian).
- **Editor design direction** — "Outline-as-Index-Page": spine rail with Roman-numeral H2s and subordinate-rail H3s, active-section pin (`--editor-active`), warm-paper editor surface distinct from the chrome's neutral `--card`. Lives in `src/components/markdown-toc.tsx`.
