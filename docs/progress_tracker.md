### Tech debt / housekeeping

- [ ] #91 — Bump JavaScript actions to Node 24-compatible majors (`actions/checkout@v4` etc.) before GitHub's Jun 2 2026 forced opt-out / Sep 16 2026 hard removal. Filed 2026-05-08 after the deprecation annotation surfaced on the first staging-on-merge run.
- [x] **#99 — Admin password reset → session invalidation** — shipped 2026-05-11, PR #128 at `fbadf98`. New `invalidateUserSessions(env, targetEmail, exceptSessionId?)` helper in `worker/auth.ts` (also fixes a latent fire-and-forget delete bug in `handleChangePassword`); cookie-path admins resetting their own password keep their current tab via `AdminScope.selfSessionId`; X-Admin-Secret path wipes wholesale. Password-reset field re-introduced in `AdminUserEditDialog` (was pulled in PR #100 pending this fix). 6 new worker tests in `tests/admin-auth.test.ts`.
- [x] **#102 — AlertDialogAction sweep** — shipped 2026-05-11, PR #108 at `65d69b5`. All five remaining destructive-confirm dialogs now use plain `<Button>` + manual close on success; policy extracted as `runConfirmedAction` helper in `src/lib/run-confirmed-action.ts` with 6 unit tests pinning the contract.
- [ ] **#117 — `/api/chat/stream` accepts arbitrary `user_id`** (deferred from 2026-05-11 retrospective batch). Worker validates UUIDv4 shape but not session ownership. Needs design call between (1) namespacing test-chat UUIDs as `test:<session.userId>:<uuid>` (smallest blast radius but wire-format change), (2) requiring `isAdmin` for cross-user, or (3) KV-tracked session→testChatUserId.
- [~] **#125 — Remove Prompt Overrides** (per Elsy + Christou, 2026-05-11 PM). Phase 1 (hide sidebar entry) shipped 2026-05-11, PR #127 at `a39954f` — single-file delete of the `<ActivityBarItem>` block + `faSliders` imports; `/prompt-configuration` route + worker proxy + upstream endpoint left intact as emergency escape. Phase 2 (full deletion of page + BFF route + types + tests) **gated on bt-servant-worker#215** — investigation surfaced that worker still consumes `_org_prompt_overrides` on every chat request via `readAllOrgKV` → DO body → `resolvePromptOverrides` → system prompt; KV inventory clear in both staging and prod (zero `{org}` keys), so worker patch will be invisible. Cross-link comment posted on portal #125 with revised sequence. (GitHub auto-closed #125 on PR #127 merge despite "Closes only partially" wording — reopened with explanation.)

## Session Log

### 2026-05-21 (late afternoon) — Tim/Elsy/Seth/Klappy Zoom + design reconciliation

**Context:** Seth joined a previously-scheduled Tim/Elsy demo walkthrough. Conversation pivoted into the shared-library / cross-org tuning design — the same territory Seth was sketching against earlier in the day with the "supermode" question. Chris Klapp also weighed in.

**Locked in this session:**

- **Two-altitude shared-library architecture** confirmed by Tim. System level holds curator-tuned modes and languages; org level adapts. Multiple system-level variants per language can coexist (Hindi base + Hindi-DCV at the same altitude).
- **Per-language curator role** confirmed — trusted individual or working group per language, write-access granted out-of-band (Zoom call) rather than self-service. Read-only cross-org browse is a primary feature.
- **Inline alternatives via comment syntax** (Bluebird Network ask) — `%%`/`++…++` per [[project_ulysses_comment_syntax]] is exactly the mechanism. Re-cast portal #77 from "editor nicety" to "core feature for shared-library alternatives."
- **Org-prefixed slugs** when modes cross orgs (`#YWAM-OBT`, `#spoken-OBT`). New convention to introduce.
- **Identity bridge admin-portal ↔ chat-app — greenlit by Tim.** Seth's prior write-up (in #serving-our-customers, thumbs-up'd by Ian) has Tim's verbal go-ahead: "I would just signal intent." Obsoletes most of the Elsy Discord reply draft from earlier today.
- **Word Collective visibility for super-admins** — Tim surprised Elsy can't see Word Collective. Underlying cause is the `worker/config.ts:94` `session.org` binding identified yesterday. Promotable from follow-up to actual priority.

**Already filed by Elsy this morning (validated by Tim in meeting):**

|          |                                           |                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **#149** | EPIC — Mode Library & Cross-Org Templates | + sub-issues #150 (org metadata), #151 (copy-on-import + provenance), #152 (uW-curated namespace + curator workflow)                                          |
| **#153** | EPIC — Governance & Versioning            | + #156 (revision states draft/pending_review/published) + worker-side versioning, optimistic concurrency, verb-based permissions, audit log, diff/timeline UI |
| **#161** | EPIC — Operational Reliability            | Carry forward, not directly discussed                                                                                                                         |

Task breakdowns were AI-drafted by Elsy (Tim noted this on call). Need critical-review pass before treating as authoritative — Tim approved substance, not breakdown details.

**Open design question — sent to team, awaiting reply:**

- **Inheritance mechanism: pure-fork (Tim's in-meeting framing) vs. cascade-with-section-granularity (Seth's preference).** Pure fork severs orgs from future curator work as forks accumulate, eroding Tim's "everyone benefits" promise. Cascade preserves that promise by inheriting blank sections from upstream while letting orgs override per section. Tagged Ian, Klappy, Tim, Elsy, Bincy. Several OOO. Holding detailed task breakdowns under #149/#153 until this lands — the breakdowns differ materially. See [[project_meta_tuning_design]] memory for full context.

**Patterns / decisions captured:**

- **Pure fork vs. cascade trade-off is real and worth resolving before code.** Pure fork is simpler to explain and avoids upstream surprises but accumulates drift; cascade preserves curator value across the lifetime of all orgs but adds per-section complexity. Refactoring fork→cascade later is non-trivial; getting it right at v1 matters.
- **AI-drafted epics need explicit critical review.** Tim approved Elsy's epics on substance but didn't audit the task breakdown. Going to code without a review pass risks shipping the AI's structure rather than the intended one.

**Updated Next Steps (supersedes earlier in the day):**

1. **Wait for team on cascade vs. fork** before detail-scoping #149/#152.
2. **Start identity-bridge work** (Seth's prior write-up) — greenlit by Tim in the meeting; no further confirmation needed.
3. **Close `worker/config.ts:94` cross-org config gap** — known limitation Tim is now aware of; was previously yesterday's follow-up #143-adjacent work. Promote.
4. **File the cascade-independent candidate issues** (org-prefixed slugs, editor syntax highlighting, Baruch language pre-fill) — coming as part of this EOD wrap.
5. **Critical-review pass on #149 + #153 sub-issues** — flag cascade-vs-fork sensitivity per task.
6. **Pioneers demo prep — BSOK org + Calvin user** with copies of Understand/Translate/Check modes for the June meeting. Date specifics to confirm with Elsy/Bincy.
7. **Elsy Discord reply** — slim to "we covered this in the 1pm Zoom, Seth has greenlight on the identity-bridge work" or let the thread close itself.

### 2026-05-21 — No-code day: Elsy super-admin scope diagnosis + understand-anything trial

**Context entering the session:** SOD opened clean. PR #145 (2026-05-20 EOD tracker entry) still sitting open and green; no movement on prod promotion of the super-admin feature. Two thin work items surfaced: a Discord question from Elsy about staging behavior, and a tooling install.

**Completed:**

- **Elsy super-admin "doesn't mirror" question — diagnosed as architecture, not bug.** Elsy reported that user/org changes made via the new super-admin UI on `staging.btservant.ai/admin/users` don't appear on `staging-app.btservant.ai/chat`. Investigation walked the seven-repo BT Servant family on GitHub and verified at `unfoldingWord/bt-servant-web-client`:
  - The chat app is a separate Next.js 16 + NextAuth 5 surface (`src/auth.config.ts` on `main`): Google OAuth + a credentials provider whose `authorize()` accepts any email and returns a user object with no password check, no lookup against the portal's `AUTH_KV`, no role gating.
  - Zero references to `isSuperAdmin` or `AUTH_KV` across the web-client codebase.
  - First-pass reply framed this as "two separate systems for everything" — Elsy correctly pushed back with a counterexample: mode edits in the portal **do** propagate to the chat app. Refined model: **configs vs. identity.** Modes/languages/prompt configs route through `bt-servant-worker` (shared backend, `staging-api.btservant.ai`); both surfaces read from `ORG_CONFIG` KV. User/role records live in the portal's own `AUTH_KV`, separate from the worker, separate from the web-client's NextAuth.
  - "Hard-wired for uW" theory falsified: web-client defaults to `DEFAULT_ORG = unfoldingWord` via env, but staging has `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ORG_SWITCHER = true` — modes made in other orgs would also show if the chat app switches context.
  - Reply drafted for Elsy with Ian teed up on the roadmap-level question: should the portal's user/role store also be the chat app's identity backend? Pending Seth send.
  - **Not filed as an issue** — this is a roadmap discussion that needs Tim + Ian, not a portal-side bugfix. Per the admin-portal-only scope rule, won't file cross-repo without alignment.

- **`/understand` knowledge graph trial (understand-anything plugin).** Installed `Lum1104/Understand-Anything` marketplace plugin, ran end-to-end on this codebase via pnpm 10 (pnpm 11 blocks native build scripts by default; tree-sitter binaries need them, so downgraded via corepack). Eight-batch parallel file-analyzer wave produced 353 nodes / 692 edges / 10 layers / 12-step guided tour over 140 files. One genuine miss caught by the assemble-reviewer (`getSessionId` in `worker/auth.ts`, 5 lines, below the significance filter but actually called from `worker/admin.ts`). Tested-by linker tagged 10 production nodes correctly (matches the 10 `.test.ts` files exactly). Dashboard up at `http://uw-sandbox.orb.local:5173/` (via `--host 0.0.0.0` after first launch only bound to container loopback).
  - **Decision:** keep `.understand-anything/` out of git (~500KB generated artifact that would churn on every refresh). Added to `.gitignore` as part of this EOD commit.
  - **Not enabling `--auto-update`** without an explicit ask — would install a commit hook; that's a higher-friction change that deserves its own conversation.

**In Progress:**

- **Elsy reply draft** — written, awaiting Seth review/send. Half-acknowledges that the unified-identity question is interesting and tees Ian up to answer whether it's on the roadmap. Length and tone calibrations offered (currently medium-length, owns the first-pass correction directly).

**Blockers / Carryover from 2026-05-20:**

- **bt-servant-worker#215** — still gates portal #125 Phase 2. No movement.
- **bt-servant-worker#191** — still gates Epic #72's fifth Goal (dynamic language-file loading). No movement.
- **#77** — still paused on Ian's editor-library decision (CodeMirror 6 tentative).
- **#117** — chat-stream user_id ownership; awaiting design call.
- **Super-admin feature** — still soaking on staging (4 commits ahead of prod since 2026-05-20). Promotion gated on Elsy's comfort.
- **#143 (worker-side `isSuperAdmin` redaction)** and **README docs PR** (CF dashboard KV-edit bootstrap path) — still on the queue from yesterday, not picked up today.

**Patterns / decisions captured today:**

- **Two-axis propagation model for the BT Servant stack.** Cross-app behavior splits cleanly along **(a) shared backend → propagates** vs **(b) per-app auth backend → does not.** Configs, modes, languages, prompts all hit `bt-servant-worker` and are therefore consistent between admin portal + chat web-client. Users, sessions, roles each live in their app's local store (portal → `AUTH_KV`; web-client → NextAuth JWT). The implication for product: anything we ship that _governs end-user behavior in the chat app_ needs to land in the worker's data model, not the portal's user model. The super-admin feature shipped where #138 asked it to (portal access), and Elsy's expectation (chat-app gating) is a different feature class.
- **First-pass framing is allowed to be wrong, but should be owned directly when falsified.** Elsy's counterexample about mode propagation falsified the "two separate systems for everything" framing in <10 minutes. The refined reply opens with "you're right, and I was too broad" rather than soft-pedaling. Cheap honesty buys more trust than careful hedging, and the corrected model (configs vs. identity) is more useful than the original.
- **pnpm 11 blocks postinstall builds by default.** Tree-sitter native binaries (`*.node` addons) need build scripts. Workaround for plugins/tools that ship tree-sitter: use pnpm 10 via `corepack prepare pnpm@10.15.0 --activate`. Long-term fix is `onlyBuiltDependencies` in `package.json` or a project-level `.npmrc` with explicit allowlist. Captured in case other tooling installs hit the same wall.
- **OrbStack containers expose ports via `<container>.orb.local` automatically — but only if the server binds to `0.0.0.0`, not container loopback.** Vite defaults to `127.0.0.1` when given `--host 127.0.0.1`; the dashboard skill passed exactly that, so the first dashboard launch was invisible from the macOS host. Rebind to `--host 0.0.0.0` and OrbStack's auto-DNS makes it reachable at `http://uw-sandbox.orb.local:<port>/`. Worth knowing for any future bg-job server we want to inspect from outside the sandbox.
- **Knowledge-graph trade-off: useful for cross-cutting questions, neutral for everyday coding.** The graph answers things grep can't (layer membership, tested-by coverage, cycle/orphan detection) and gives a fresh agent a mental model in seconds. It's not a function-level source of truth (one short helper was missed) and it goes stale the moment you merge. For this project specifically, the marginal value over the existing CLAUDE.md is modest — would shine more on a larger/less-documented codebase. Not committed; agents can regenerate locally on demand.

**Next Steps:**

- **Send Elsy reply** (Seth's call) — once sent, Ian's response on the unified-identity question determines whether to file a roadmap-level cross-repo issue or document the portal-vs-chat scope distinction somewhere durable.
- **#143 worker-side `isSuperAdmin` redaction** — still the smallest, highest-signal next code task (~30-min PR, defense-in-depth on yesterday's #142 P2 fix).
- **README docs PR** — CF dashboard KV-edit alternative to `op run -- curl`. Tiny.
- **Prod promotion of super-admin feature** — once Elsy confirms comfort.
- **#144 org slug case-normalization** — still needs design call on migration plan before scoping.

### 2026-05-20 — Super-admin feature end-to-end (3 PRs, helping Elsy onboard Haneen)

**Context entering the session:** SOD opened clean (5 days since last session, no new prod work). Then Ian/Elsy raised the question on Discord: how does one create a new org for the admin portal? Elsy needs to onboard Haneen for the demo and was blocked on engineering.

**Completed:**

- **#139 + PR #140 — `npm run create-org-admin` CLI stopgap.** Audit of the current code showed there's no UI for cross-org user creation: org-scoped admins are restricted to their own org (`worker/admin.ts:170`); `AdminUserCreateDialog` hardcodes `org: callerOrg`. The only cross-org path is the X-Admin-Secret CLI curl. Filed #138 (proper super-admin UI) + #139 (stopgap script) and shipped #139 first to unblock tonight's onboarding. Script in `scripts/create-org-admin.mjs` (plain Node 22 `.mjs`, no transpile, no new dep), wrapped via `npm run create-org-admin`. Reads `ADMIN_SECRET` from env (works with `op run --`), defaults to staging, refuses prod without `--confirm-prod`, `--dry-run` prints the constructed POST without sending. Auto-generates 16-char base64url passwords. README gains "Bootstrapping a new org" section. Merged at `4f7d5cb`. **Frank P1 round:** `--confirm-prod` only checked `--env prod`, but `--url` could target the known prod URL while `--env` defaulted to staging. Fix: classify the _resolved_ URL (`classifyResolvedUrl()` helper) and require `--confirm-prod` for known-prod URLs AND for any unknown `--url` override (treat-as-prod by default). Frank re-review clean.

- **#138 + PR #141 — `isSuperAdmin` role + super-by-session backend.** Two-PR split (A: backend, B: frontend) per design alignment with Seth. PR A:
  - `StoredUser.isSuperAdmin?: boolean` + `SessionData.isSuperAdmin?: boolean` (optional + undefined-as-falsy → zero KV migration).
  - `validateSession` re-hydrates the field on every request via the existing live-rehydration path; `handleLogin` + `handleMe` include it in responses.
  - New `AdminScope` variant `{ kind: "super-by-session"; selfEmail; selfSessionId }` alongside existing `super` and `org`. `requireAdminAuth` returns it when `session.isSuperAdmin === true`.
  - **"Super trumps isAdmin" rule:** a session with `isSuperAdmin: true` passes admin auth even if `isAdmin: false`. Without this, a super-admin who self-demoted isAdmin (allowed; they retain cross-org via super) would silently lock out on next request.
  - Cross-org filters in `createUser`/`listUsers`/`updateUser`/`deleteUser` short-circuit via `isCrossOrgScope(scope)`.
  - **Loud 403 over silent drop:** org admins attempting to grant or revoke isSuperAdmin get a `403 Cannot modify isSuperAdmin from your scope` rather than the field being silently dropped. Symmetric on grant and revoke. Defense in depth.
  - Self-mutation guards: super-by-session can self-demote isAdmin (super remains) but cannot self-demote isSuperAdmin (would lock out) and cannot self-delete. X-Admin-Secret CLI remains the recovery escape.
  - `safeUser` exposes `isSuperAdmin` so PR B's UI can render badges without a second round-trip.
  - 16 new tests (176 → 192 total): cross-org powers, super-trumps admit, self-mutation guards, org-admin escalation defense, X-Admin-Secret regression.
  - Merged at `d958b18`. **Frank P1+P2 round:** (P1) `.gitleaks.toml` path-allowlist was too broad — disabled every rule under `tests/*.test.ts`, not just generic-api-key false positives; (P2) `worker/config.ts:74` mutation auth checked only `session.isAdmin`, so a super-admin who self-demoted isAdmin (now allowed!) would get 403 on prompt-overrides / modes / languages writes despite the worker letting them into `/api/admin/users`. Fixes: extracted `hasAdminPowers(session) = isAdmin || isSuperAdmin` helper in `worker/config.ts`; narrowed gitleaks to `condition = "AND"` + `paths` + regex-shape on the matched secret (real credentials with AKIA / ghp* / sk* / slashes still flagged). 5 new config-authz tests pin the parity. Frank re-review clean.

- **#138 + PR #142 — Super-admin UI on `/admin/users` (frontend).** Closes #138.
  - `lib/permissions.ts` gains `hasAdminPowers(user)` — mirror of the worker helper; "super trumps" rule encoded in one place per side.
  - `RequireAdmin` + `ActivityBar` (Modes + Users entries) switch from `s.user?.isAdmin` to `hasAdminPowers(s.user)` so super-admins without isAdmin still see the sidebar entries and pass the route gate.
  - `AdminUserCreateDialog` + `AdminUserEditDialog` accept `callerIsSuperAdmin` prop. When set: editable Org field (create: free-text, pre-filled with `callerOrg`; edit: move-org with current value); Super-admin checkbox. Edit-dialog Super-admin checkbox disabled when `isSelf && already-super` (mirrors worker's 400 on self-demote-super). Submit handlers omit isSuperAdmin from the body for non-super callers (worker would 403 on `false`).
  - `AdminUsersPage` for super-admins: subtitle changes; Org column added; org filter dropdown (shadcn Select with sentinel "all" value); empty-state when filter yields zero rows; Super badge in role cell (initially mis-gated — see Frank fix below).
  - 7 new tests on `hasAdminPowers` truth table (188 total at PR open).
  - README updated: "Bootstrapping a new org" mentions the UI path now exists; new "Bootstrapping a super admin" section with the one-time PUT curl.
  - Merged at `ee7931d`. **Frank P2+P3 round:** (P2) Super badge was gated on `user.isSuperAdmin` alone, not also on `callerIsSuperAdmin`. Worker's `safeUser` returns isSuperAdmin to every admin caller including org admins viewing their own org-filtered list, so an org admin viewing a same-org colleague who also held super would see the cross-org role. (P3) The `__all__` org-filter sentinel could collide with a real org slug (orgs are free-text). Fixes: one-line gate on the badge plus a corrected comment; renamed sentinel to `ORG_FILTER_ALL_SENTINEL = "@@bt-servant:all-orgs@@"` centralized in `src/lib/admin-users-api.ts`; new `isReservedOrgSlug` helper + dialog guards reject creating/moving to the sentinel value. 4 new tests on the helper. Frank re-review clean.

- **Bootstrap end-to-end on staging.** `op` CLI isn't installed in `uw-sandbox`, so the README's `op run -- curl` recipe wasn't directly usable. Worked around two ways: (1) ad-hoc `ADMIN_SECRET='...' curl ...` (inline); (2) **KV-edit via the CF dashboard** — find `user:<email>` in `AUTH_KV` (staging KV ID `76b77b269f7c48b481f3448955950b57`), add `"isSuperAdmin": true` to the JSON value, save. Live re-hydration in `validateSession` (per PR A) means it takes effect on the next request — no logout/login needed. Then created Haneen's org from the UI: clicked "New user", typed a brand-new slug in the Org field, submitted. Verified the org appears in the filter dropdown. Whole feature confirmed working in the same session it shipped.

- **#143 filed — Worker-side `isSuperAdmin` redaction (follow-up).** Frank P2 closed the visible leak (badge gated by viewer) but the field is still on the wire for org-admin callers. Proper fix: parameterize `safeUser()` by viewer scope, omit `isSuperAdmin` from responses when caller is org-scoped. ~30-min PR, three call-site updates, three tests. Cross-linked to #138/#141/#142.

- **#144 filed — Org slug case-normalization (foot-gun).** Surfaced post-shipping when Seth asked whether org names are case-sensitive. They are — strict `===` everywhere, while emails are normalized to lowercase at `admin.ts:160`. So `Haneen` vs `haneen` are distinct orgs with separate users / modes / languages. Issue body proposes mirroring the email pattern (`org?.trim().toLowerCase()`) **but flags the migration concern**: without rewriting existing KV records AND coordinating with bt-servant-worker's per-org engine namespaces, lazy normalization would create org-cohesion drift (new users in `acme`, existing users still in `Acme`). Recommendation in the issue: don't ship until migration plan is scoped; lower-effort partial would be UI-side lowercasing-as-you-type.

**Day rollup:**

| Merged | Commit    | Closes |
| ------ | --------- | ------ |
| #140   | `4f7d5cb` | #139   |
| #141   | `d958b18` | —      |
| #142   | `ee7931d` | #138   |

**3 PRs merged, 2 issues auto-closed (#138, #139), 4 issues filed today (#138, #139, #143, #144), super-admin feature shipped end-to-end to staging and confirmed working via real bootstrap + new-org creation.**

**In Progress:**

- None code-wise. Staging is 4 commits ahead of last prod deploy (`25ea9c1` → `ee7931d`). Super-admin feature soaking on staging.

**Blockers:**

- **bt-servant-worker#215** — still gates portal #125 Phase 2. Ian's queue; no movement since 2026-05-11.
- **bt-servant-worker#191** — still gates Epic #72's fifth Goal (dynamic language-file loading). Ian's queue; no movement since 2026-05-06.
- **#77** — still paused on Ian's editor-library decision (CodeMirror 6 tentative).
- **#117** — chat-stream user_id ownership; awaiting design call.

**Patterns / decisions captured today:**

- **"Super trumps isAdmin" applied uniformly.** Initially shipped only in `worker/admin.ts requireAdminAuth`; Frank's PR #141 P2 caught the missing parity in `worker/config.ts` (prompt-overrides / modes / languages mutation auth). Now encoded as `hasAdminPowers(session)` in both worker/config.ts and src/lib/permissions.ts. Lesson: when introducing a new role with "trumps" semantics, audit every existing auth gate, not just the obvious one.
- **Loud 403 over silent drop.** When a body field is restricted by scope (`isSuperAdmin` only honorable by super scopes), reject with explicit 403 rather than silently ignoring. Silent drop masks UI bugs and lets attackers probe for missing checks.
- **Org-as-emergent-entity.** "Creating an org" = creating the first user with a new org slug. No separate orgs registry, no create-org API, no two-step UX. The free-text Org field in the dialog implicitly covers both "add user to existing org" and "create new org" paths. Elegant — but the trade-off (no validation) surfaced #144's case-sensitivity foot-gun.
- **KV-edit as alternative bootstrap.** `op`-less environments can edit `user:<email>` in `AUTH_KV` directly via the CF dashboard. Live re-hydration in `validateSession` means no logout. Worth documenting alongside the curl-based bootstrap (small README PR not done today).
- **Gitleaks PR-history vs. tip-only scope.** The scanner sees every commit added by a PR. Renaming a flagged string in a follow-up commit doesn't clear earlier-commit findings — gitleaks reads the file from the commit being scanned, not from HEAD. Durable fix is a `.gitleaks.toml` allowlist (centralized); ad-hoc renames only help if the original commit can be force-pushed away (CLAUDE.md gates that).
- **Gitleaks per-rule scope quirks.** Tried `targetRules` to scope an allowlist to a specific rule in 8.24.3 — config loaded but the per-rule scoping didn't filter. Pivoted to `condition = "AND"` with `paths` + regex-shape constraint on the matched secret. Outcome is narrower than path-only allowlist (per Frank's P1) without depending on `targetRules` working.
- **Sentinel-pattern for Radix Select "no filter".** Radix Select disallows empty-string values, so the "All orgs" entry needs a literal stand-in. Used `"@@bt-servant:all-orgs@@"` (distinctive bracketing + namespace), centralized in `src/lib/admin-users-api.ts` with an `isReservedOrgSlug` helper for create/edit dialog guards. Pattern reusable for any future "no filter" Select.
- **Frank-collaboration pattern this session:** three PRs, three review cycles, all clean on re-review after one round of fixes. P-level severities consistently P1/P2 (real bugs); response cycle averaged ~15 min from finding to push. Treating Frank's "I don't have evidence X works" caveats as separate-from-findings is the right framing — they're acknowledgement of test-coverage gaps, not blockers.

**Next Steps:**

- **#143 — Worker-side `isSuperAdmin` redaction.** ~30-min PR. Defense-in-depth follow-up to today's PR #142 P2 fix. Field-omit in `safeUser` for non-super scopes. Three call-site updates + three tests.
- **README docs PR.** Mention CF dashboard KV-edit as alternative to `op run -- curl` for super-admin bootstrap. Tiny.
- **Prod promotion.** Super-admin feature soaking on staging since today; promote when Elsy is comfortable. Would also need a fresh KV-edit (or curl) on prod to bootstrap a super admin there — staging's bootstrap doesn't carry over.
- **#144** — needs design call on the migration before scoping. Don't ship lowercase-at-boundary without a plan for existing mixed-case data.
- Yesterday's deferred items still available if a smaller next-task is wanted: User Memory enhancements (#56/#57/#53), deep links (#28), shell perf nit (#52).

### 2026-05-07 — Project kickoff + per-PR deploys + #75 markdown editor

**Completed:**

- **Repo setup** — `git init` in `/workspace/bt-servant-admin-portal`, added `unfoldingWord` remote, fetched `main`. Migrated Claude state from host to uw-sandbox container.
- **Epic #72 triage** — Read all existing sub-issues (#73–#77), audited the codebase, identified gaps in the Epic's filings, drafted six new sub-issues (Drafts A–F) covering: Languages CRUD API, language-shepherd permissions, test-chat wiring, trigger syntax, mode migration, comment-block stripping.
- **Filed sub-issues** — #79, #80, #81, #82 (this repo); #203, #204, #205 (engine repo). All cross-linked. #82 + #204 paired and gated.
- **Updated #77 + engine #205** — Tim Jore corrected the comment-syntax convention to canonical Ulysses (`%%` paragraph + `++…++` span, not the `&&...&&` originally proposed). Researched against official Ulysses docs (help.ulysses.app), posted findings with provenance on both issues.
- **#83 — Per-PR ephemeral CF Workers** — filed, implemented, reviewed by Frank (P1 caught: `wrangler delete` needs `--force` in CI), fixed, re-reviewed clean, merged at `3e8d087`.
- **#75 — Markdown editor + TOC** — Designed via cowork mockup with frontend-design skill pass ("Outline-as-Index-Page" direction: spine rail + Roman numerals + active-section pin + paper-toned editor surface). Aligned mockup to project tokens (Outfit-only typography, FA Pro convention noted). Lifted into source: parser, types, two components, three hooks, design tokens. Merged at `e347370`.
- **Pattern doc** — Wrote up the per-PR deploy mechanism as a reusable reference for Ian to adopt in sibling repos (engine, data-loaders).

**In Progress:**

- None — both shipped items merged. Next session opens with sub-issue selection from the Epic #72 list above.

**Blockers:**

- None.

**Next Steps:**

- Pick the next Epic #72 sub-issue to start. Most foundational and parallelizable: **#79 (Languages CRUD API)** — design-independent, foundational for #73 + #80. After that, **#76 (replace six-box editor)** is the natural follow-on now that #75 has shipped, but it's gated on engine #204 deploying first.
- Validate engine team progress on #203, #204, #205 before locking the consumer-side work.
- AGENTS.md is untracked (Codex-equivalent of CLAUDE.md, generated locally, not in git). Decide whether to commit, add to `.gitignore`, or leave untracked.
- Consider whether the GitHub Actions workflows are using deprecated Node.js 20 — `actions/checkout@v4`, `actions/setup-node@v4` etc. flagged as deprecated by Sept 2026. Worth a tech-debt issue but not urgent.

### 2026-05-08 — Lockfile/Node bump, staging-on-merge, Languages API + sidebar

**Completed:**

- **PR #86** — committed yesterday's progress-tracker entry (`docs: seed progress_tracker with 2026-05-07 EOD entry`); also picked up a CI tweak that landed the same morning (`d5dc15d` — skip `deploy-pr.yml` + `cleanup-pr.yml` for docs-only PRs via `paths-ignore`). Merged.
- **PR #87 — Lockfile refresh + Node 20→22 bump.** Pre-commit (husky → lint-staged) was failing locally with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` on `nano-spawn/source/index.js` — the published `nano-spawn@2.0.0` tarball is missing `source/index.js` and the lockfile pinned that broken version. Refreshed the lockfile (lint-staged 16.2.7 → 16.4.0 within `^16.2.7`, drops nano-spawn entirely). Lockfile refresh also bumped wrangler 4.69.0 → 4.90.0 within `^4.62.0`, and 4.90.0 requires Node ≥22 — so all five workflows bumped from `node-version: 20` → `22`. Verified safe vs sister repos (Python; independent CI). Merged.
- **PR #88 — `chore: track AGENTS.md + reference mockup`.** Committed AGENTS.md (Codex equivalent of CLAUDE.md) and `mockups/mockup.png`. Validated the docs-only paths-ignore from `d5dc15d` end-to-end — the per-PR Cloudflare Worker deploy job was correctly absent from PR #88's checks. Merged.
- **PR #90 / #89 — Direct staging deploy on PR merge.** Filed #89 capturing Ian's request with three implementation options. Implemented Option A: `deploy-staging.yml` trigger swapped from indirect `workflow_run: { workflows: ["CI"] }` to `pull_request: { types: [closed] }` gated on `merged == true`. Same `paths-ignore` as `deploy-pr.yml` (docs-only PRs skip), `concurrency: deploy-staging` for serialization, `workflow_dispatch` retained as manual recovery, comment-back on the merged PR with worker name + URL + merge commit SHA. Frank P2: added `npm run typecheck` before `npm run build` (vite strips types). Merged. Validated end-to-end: the merge of #90 itself fired the new workflow, then #92 and #93 each fired cleanly (33s / 45s).
- **PR #92 / #79 — Languages CRUD API in worker BFF + frontend client.** Mirrors the existing modes API surface. New `worker/config.ts` routes `/api/config/languages` (GET) + `/api/config/languages/{name}` (GET/PUT/DELETE) proxying to engine `/api/v1/admin/orgs/{org}/languages`. New `Language { name, label?, document, published? }` type — asymmetric from `PromptMode` because language tuning is one markdown `document`, not slotted overrides (per #76). New `src/lib/languages-api.ts` with `listLanguages` / `getLanguage` / `putLanguage` / `deleteLanguage` mirroring config-api mode helpers. Filed engine companion `bt-servant-engine#206` and linked from #79 per the acceptance criterion. Frank cleared with no findings. Merged.
- **PR #93 / #73 — Languages sidebar tab + editor integration.** First user-visible consumer of the editor + TOC components from #75 and the API client from #79. New activity-bar entry (`faLanguage` Pro icon, light + solid) below the existing manual-config entry. New `/languages` route → `LanguagesPage` with `LanguageSelector` toolbar + `MarkdownToc` (280px) + `MarkdownEditor` (flex-1). Auto-save with 800ms debounce + manual `Save` button + status indicator. Two unsaved-changes guards: cross-route `useBlocker` confirm + in-page language-switch confirm. Permission gating stubbed with `TODO(#80)` (always visible until engine delivers `session.language_rights`). Frank caught **two P1s + one P2** across two reviews:
  - **P1.1**: `useBlocker` only works under a data router. Migrated `App.tsx` from `<BrowserRouter>` to `createBrowserRouter` + `RouterProvider`; hooks needing router context (`useSyncSection`, `useSessionGuard`) moved into a new `RootLayout` route element.
  - **P1.2**: Autosave race could lose user edits — the post-save `setDraft(serverDocument)` overwrote in-flight typing because the React Query cache lags real saves. Replaced `serverDocument`-based dirty-detection with a separate `lastSyncedDoc` advanced only on (a) initial load / language switch (gated on `query.data.name === selectedLanguage` so a stale response from the previous selection can't slip in) and (b) successful save with the value captured in the mutation closure. Autosave effect's deps now include `saveLanguage.isPending` + `lastSyncedDoc` so it retries when an in-flight save settles.
  - **P2**: Same class of bug for `published` — autosave fired right after Publish/Unpublish read stale `serverPublished` from the cache and reverted the toggle. Added parallel `lastSyncedPublished` tracking, advanced on the same triggers as `lastSyncedDoc`. Frank cleared the re-re-review. Merged.
- **#91 filed** — `Bump JavaScript actions to Node 24-compatible majors`. Surfaced via the GitHub deprecation annotation on the first staging-on-merge run. Captures the five action pins (`actions/checkout@v4`, `actions/setup-node@v4`, `actions/github-script@v7`, `actions/upload-artifact@v4`, `gitleaks/gitleaks-action@v2`) and the `FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24=true` escape hatch. Deadline Jun 2 2026 forced opt-out / Sep 16 2026 hard removal.

**In Progress:**

- None — all today's PRs merged. #93's permission gating is the only stubbed work, blocked on #80 (engine half).

**Blockers:**

- **bt-servant-engine#206** (Language CRUD endpoints) blocks real end-to-end validation of #79 + #73 plumbing. Until it lands, GET/PUT/DELETE calls on `/api/config/languages/*` go through the worker proxy and return whatever the engine returns for the unimplemented path (likely 404). The empty-state in `LanguagesPage` handles this gracefully.
- **bt-servant-engine#203, #204, #205** — same status as yesterday; consumer work in #76 / #82 / #77's prompt-stripping half remains blocked on engine progress.

**Next Steps:**

- **#80 (language-shepherd permissions)** is the natural next pick. It directly unblocks proper gating in the Languages tab I just shipped (currently stubbed `TODO(#80)`). Portal-side scope is small: extend `/api/auth/session` consumer to read `language_rights`, gate the activity-bar entry, layer 403 handling in `languages-api.ts`. Engine half (admin tooling for granting rights) is independent.
- Other unblocked candidates: **#74** (heading scaffold for new language documents — now has the editor integration point from #73) and **#77 editor-side** (comment-block syntax — engine-side stripping at #205 is still blocked).
- Watch for **bt-servant-engine#206** to land so we can smoke-test the language CRUD round-trip end-to-end. Coordinate with engine team.

### 2026-05-08 (afternoon) — Language-shepherd permissions end-to-end + Users admin UI

**Completed:**

- **PR #95 / #80 — Language-shepherd permissions (`language_rights`).** Worker-side defense-in-depth → sole authorization gate after architectural redesign. Frontend gating: activity-bar tab grays out + tooltips when rights is `[]`, dropdown filters via `filterAuthorizedLanguages`, `LanguageForbiddenError` typed exception surfaces inline (per #80 AC, not toast), auto-deselects persisted-but-now-forbidden selections, `NoAccessState` for URL-hacked navigation. Back-compat default: `undefined` → full access so existing pre-permission users aren't locked out. **Five Frank review rounds**:
  - **Round 1** — initial implementation. Filed engine companion `bt-servant-engine#207` under the wrong assumption that engine controls session payloads.
  - **Round 2 (P1+P2)** — `language_rights` had no source path (engine doesn't populate sessions; portal owns auth via `AUTH_KV`); delete 403s weren't surfaced inline. Investigated engine codebase via Explore agent: confirmed engine is a **trusted-portal model** (single shared `ADMIN_API_TOKEN`, zero user identity on admin paths). Closed engine #207 wontfix-by-design. Re-implemented with `StoredUser.language_rights` as the source: portal owns rights end-to-end, KV-backed, threaded through `worker/admin.ts createUser/updateUser/safeUser` → `handleLogin sessionData` → `AuthUser`. Filed follow-up #96 for the missing assignment UX.
  - **Round 3 (P1)** — stale sessions retained stale rights for up to 7 days. `validateSession` was reading the cached payload from `session:${id}` and skipping a live read on the `user:${email}` record. Fixed: hydrate `isAdmin` + `language_rights` from `StoredUser` on every request.
  - **Round 4 (P1)** — round-3 fix introduced a mixed-org authorization bug: hydrated privileges without hydrating their authorization boundary (`org`). Frank correctly pointed out every engine path is `/api/v1/.../orgs/${session.org}/...`, so a user moved org-A→org-B (with newly granted `isAdmin` from round-3 hydration) could exercise new privileges against org-A until expiry. Fixed: only `userId` and `createdAt` are session-immutable; everything else (email, name, org, isAdmin, language_rights) is derived live from `StoredUser`. Plus a low-severity stale-comment fix on round 5. Approved + merged at `b349707`.
- **PR #97 / #96 backend — Dual-auth + org-scoping on `/api/admin/users`.** New `requireAdminAuth` returning `AdminScope = { kind: "super" } | { kind: "org"; org; selfEmail }`. `X-Admin-Secret` keeps the super (cross-org, no-CSRF-needed) path. Cookie path requires `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest` + `isAdmin === true` and is org-scoped. Cross-org ops 404 (avoid enumeration). Move-org PUT 403. Self-mutation guards: 400 on self-delete and self-demote (X-Admin-Secret stays as recovery). Frank P2 round 1: no executable verification of the matrix. **Bootstrapped vitest worker test infrastructure** mirroring `bt-servant-worker`'s pattern: `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` + miniflare + `Cloudflare.Env` augmented to extend `WorkerEnv` so tests are fully typed; `tests/admin-auth.test.ts` with **17 tests** covering the full matrix (super-scope, cookie-scope, mixed paths, all 4 CRUD ops, self-mutation guards, language_rights assignment). CI runs `npm test` in the Code Quality job. Tests run in ~500ms. Frank cleared no medium+. Merged at `8a1c345`.
- **PR #100 / #96 frontend — Users admin page.** Built on top of the dual-auth backend: new activity-bar entry gated on `session.isAdmin`, `/admin/users` route with `<RequireAdmin>` gate, table view with create/edit/delete dialogs, reusable `LanguageRightsSelector` (full / specific / no-access modes with chip-style multi-select). Typed errors: `AdminUsersForbiddenError` + `AdminUsersRequestError`, inline error display on dialogs (no toasts). Pulled the password-reset field from the edit dialog after discovering the backend doesn't invalidate target user's existing sessions on PUT — filed #99 to fix that backend gap; field can be re-added once #99 lands. Frank caught **one P2** on round 1: delete-confirm `AlertDialogAction` auto-closed before async error could render, fixed by swapping for a plain destructive `Button` with manual close on success. Merged at `e119596`.

**Architectural decisions captured today:**

- **Engine is a trusted-portal model.** Verified by reading `bt_servant_engine/.../dependencies.py`: admin endpoints authenticate via a single shared `ADMIN_API_TOKEN`, no user identity extraction. Engine cannot enforce per-user authorization on admin paths because it doesn't know which user is calling. Implication: any portal feature involving per-user authorization on engine endpoints must be enforced by the portal worker BFF before calling engine.
- **Portal owns the user model end-to-end** (KV-backed `StoredUser` in `AUTH_KV`). `language_rights` lives on `StoredUser` and is set via `/api/admin/users`, threaded through `SessionData` at login. No engine integration to coordinate.
- **Live session hydration on every request.** `validateSession` reads the user record on every authenticated request and overlays everything except `userId` + `createdAt`. Privilege grants/revocations and org moves take effect on the next request, not at session expiry. Cost is one JSON parse — the KV read was already happening for the existence check.
- **Dual-auth on admin endpoints.** `X-Admin-Secret` stays as the super-admin / CLI recovery path (no CSRF needed; the secret IS the auth). Session-cookie + `isAdmin` is the browser path; org-scoped, requires `X-Requested-With` for CSRF. Self-mutation guards apply only to the cookie path so the secret remains a true recovery escape.
- **Worker test infrastructure now exists.** `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` + miniflare for in-memory KV. `Cloudflare.Env` is augmented to extend `WorkerEnv` (single source of truth on the binding shape). Future worker PRs have a test surface ready.

**In Progress:**

- None — all today's PRs merged. #99 (password-reset session invalidation) and the AlertDialogAction sweep on `language-selector.tsx` are filed/noted for future work.

**Blockers:**

- **bt-servant-engine#206** — same status. End-to-end smoke test of language CRUD still blocked on engine team shipping the endpoints.
- **bt-servant-engine#203, #204, #205** — same status; engine-dependent portal sub-issues (#76, #77 prompt-stripping, #82) remain blocked.

**Next Steps:**

- **#74 (heading scaffold for new language documents)** is the smallest unblocked Epic-#72 win. The editor integration point from #73 is in place; just needs a parser/template that injects a default H2/H3 outline when creating a new language with empty document.
- **#77 editor-side** (Ulysses comment-block syntax in the markdown editor) is independent of engine #205. Editor parsing/highlighting can ship; engine-side stripping continues blocked.
- **#81** (wire test chat to active mode + language selection) is technically unblocked but coupling to chat plumbing makes it bigger than #74 or #77. Probably last of the trio.
- **#99** (password-reset session invalidation) and the **AlertDialogAction sweep** on `language-selector.tsx` are good handoff candidates if anyone else picks up small tasks.

### 2026-05-08 (evening) — Cross-repo issue audit, family-wide misfile correction, #78 shipped

**Completed:**

- **PR #103 / #78 — Brand-color context accents for mode/language editor pages.** First Epic-#72 win this session. `PageHeader` gains an optional `variant: "modes" | "languages"` prop that paints a 3px top accent strip in Inspire blue (`oklch(0.71 0.108 226)`) for Modes / Cultivate teal (`oklch(0.78 0.054 195)`) for Languages. Other PageHeader consumers (Baruch, Admin Users) stay neutral. New tokens land as `--brand-modes` / `--brand-languages` in `globals.css` (light + dark). Color carries via CSS variable so future theme work can re-tune without touching the component. Frank cleared no medium+. Merged at `4cb84cd`.
- **Cross-repo issue audit + 5 misfile corrections.** Discovered the portal's `ENGINE_BASE_URL` (`api.btservant.ai`) actually proxies to **`bt-servant-worker`**, not `bt-servant-engine`. The engine is a separate Python/FastAPI service that's been dormant since 2026-01-16 (last commit) — closed engine #178 "EPIC: CloudFlare Rebuild" (2026-01-15) was the cutover point. All chat orchestration, modes, prompt-overrides, languages-when-they-exist, and per-user state live in `bt-servant-worker/src/index.ts`. Five engine issues filed during the Epic-#72 push were misfiled: refiled to bt-servant-worker as #197 (Languages CRUD ← engine #206), #199 (trigger syntax ← engine #203), #200 (mode migration ← engine #204), #201 (Ulysses comment stripping ← engine #205); engine #207 was already self-closed wontfix-by-design earlier in the day. Each engine issue closed with a redirect comment.
- **New worker issue filed: bt-servant-worker#198** (per-org language scaffold endpoint) — companion to portal #74 once languages CRUD ships in worker.
- **Portal issue triage pass.** 36 open admin-portal issues inventoried; only 7 were on radar via the progress tracker. Outcomes:
  - **Filed:** portal #102 (AlertDialogAction sweep — known anti-pattern in `language-selector.tsx` + `mode-selector.tsx` + `user-memory-dialog.tsx`).
  - **Closed-with-evidence:** #15 (org-badge `dark:text-primary/70` removed at cited location), #17 (theme-toggle icon flipped per recommended fix), #26 (baruch SSE handling already in `worker/baruch.ts:148-190` since baruch PR #4 merged 2026-03-09), #42 (worker `MAX_OVERRIDE_LENGTH` 4000→8000 in worker PR #167 + portal doesn't enforce client-side limit anyway).
  - **Cross-linked:** #74 → worker #198 dependency; #76 → noted #28 / #54 / #55 / #59-bullet-3 will be obsoleted/subsumed; #81 → noted #50 dedupe overlap.
  - **Stamped:** ~21 March-2026 backlog issues each got a "confirmed still applicable as of 2026-05-08" comment with current file:line evidence, so future contributors don't redo the verification.

**In Progress:**

- **#77 visual highlighting half** — paused awaiting Ian's input on editor-library decision (CodeMirror 6 tentative; comment posted with three options + tradeoffs).

**Blockers:**

- **bt-servant-worker#197** (Languages CRUD) — gates portal #74, #76, #82 + real validation of #79 / #73.
- **bt-servant-worker#198** (Language scaffold endpoint) — gates portal #74.
- **bt-servant-worker#199** (`#<mode> @<language>` trigger syntax) — gates full functionality of portal #81.
- **bt-servant-worker#200** (Mode data migration Phase 1) — gates portal #76, #82.
- **bt-servant-worker#201** (Ulysses comment stripping at prompt assembly) — engine half of portal #77; portal-side editor highlighting is independent.
- **Portal #77 (visual highlighting)** — paused on Ian for editor-library decision.

**Architectural decisions captured today:**

- **The portal's API target is `bt-servant-worker`, not `bt-servant-engine`.** Verified via `wrangler.jsonc:15` (`ENGINE_BASE_URL: https://api.btservant.ai`) + `bt-servant-worker/src/index.ts:488-604` (modes endpoints registered there) + `bt-servant-engine/bt_servant_engine/apps/api/app.py` (no `orgs/*` admin routes — only `health`, `admin_logs`, `admin_status_messages`, `admin_datastore`, `admin_keys`, `chat`, `users`). The env var name is misleading; semantically it's `WORKER_BASE_URL`. Worker is the actual orchestrator: chat (Claude Sonnet), MCP tool dispatch, sandbox, memory, user state, modes/prompt-overrides/languages-when-they-ship. Future backend work for the portal lands in `bt-servant-worker`.
- **bt-servant-engine is dormant.** Last commit 2026-01-16; last merged PR 2026-01-07 (#177). Closed engine #178 "CloudFlare Rebuild" (2026-01-15) was the migration. Engine #172 "Detangle WhatsApp logic from BT Servant Engine logic" (closed 2025-12-09) confirms WhatsApp also moved off engine. The whatsapp-gateway repo's `wrangler.toml` confirms `ENGINE_BASE_URL = https://api.btservant.ai` (= worker). Future portal/whatsapp-gateway backend work goes to bt-servant-worker.
- **bt-servant family inventory (15 repos):** `bt-servant-worker` (active, primary API), `bt-servant-admin-portal` (this), `bt-servant-engine` (dormant), `bt-servant-engine-data-loaders`, `bt-servant-whatsapp-gateway`, `bt-servant-web-client`, `bt-servant-message-broker`, `bt-servant-kb-worker`, `bt-servant-log-viewer`, `bt-servant-telemetry`, `bt-servant-site`, `bt-servant-report-sender`, `baruch` (separate prefix; setup AI assistant), `engineering-practices`. The portal's Epic-#72 backend dependencies all live in `bt-servant-worker`.

**Next Steps:**

- **Wait on Ian for portal #77 editor-library decision** (CodeMirror 6 tentative; awaiting sign-off before code).
- **Unblocked Epic-#72 picks:** **#81 mode-only** ships as a half-feature against worker today (language portion blocked on worker #197 + #199); avoid unless half-feature is acceptable. **#74, #76, #77 visual half, #82** all blocked on bt-servant-worker.
- **Other unblocked portal-side wins** (not Epic #72): **#102** (AlertDialogAction sweep — small, mechanical, three components), **#99** (admin password-reset session invalidation in portal worker BFF), **#91** (Node 24 actions bump, time-bound Sep 2026).
- **Watch bt-servant-worker** for any of #197 / #198 / #199 / #200 / #201 to land — each unblocks portal-side work.

### 2026-05-11 (morning) — Worker weekend cleared 4 blockers; portal shipped #74, #81, #102

**Context entering the session:** Ian shipped five worker PRs over the weekend, closing four of the five worker blockers (#197, #198, #199, #200; only #201 remained). Demo path `#spoken @arabic` end-to-end is now unblocked at the engine layer.

**Completed:**

- **PR #105 — AGENTS.md uw-sandbox routing note.** Tiny housekeeping: explicit "run npm/wrangler/etc. inside `uw-sandbox`" instruction added at the top of `AGENTS.md` Commands section. Prevents host/container toolchain drift. Frank cleared no findings. Merged at `cca0f72`.
- **PR #106 / #74 — Pre-load structural scaffold for new language documents.** Wires the portal to bt-servant-worker's new per-org `language-scaffold` endpoint (worker PR #205). New `useLanguageScaffold` hook + `getLanguageScaffold` API client + BFF route (`GET /api/config/language-scaffold` only; PUT/DELETE not exposed yet — no UI to gate them). `LanguagesPage.handleCreateLanguage` reads cached scaffold; on create the new doc opens with the org's structural template (5 H2 sections with `%%` Ulysses guidance comments) instead of an empty textarea. **Drive-by:** `putLanguage` unwrap fix to match `getLanguage` (response shape was `{ org, language, message }` but the client cast it directly as `Language`). Tests added for scaffold + putLanguage unwrap (10 cases total via `vi.spyOn(globalThis.fetch)`). **Frank P2:** the initial cut fell back to `document: ""` when the scaffold query hadn't resolved or had failed — that's exactly the bug the feature meant to fix. Two-layer gate landed in `5b532f4`: Create button disabled until `scaffoldQuery.isSuccess`, with inline loading/error message; `handleCreateLanguage` hard-returns if scaffold data is absent. Frank re-reviewed clean. Merged at `266017b`.
- **PR #107 / #81 — Wire test chat to active mode + language selection.** Pre-pends `#<mode> @<language>` from the editor-tab selections to the outgoing chat message; the worker classifier strips both matched and unmatched tokens before history, so the prepended trigger never pollutes the stored conversation. New `applyTriggerPrefix` pure helper + 9 unit tests covering all (mode×lang) null/set permutations, message preservation, power-user mid-message-trigger override case, and empty message edge. New `<ActiveTriggerStrip>` row below the chat header shows the literal trigger that will be prepended (e.g. `#spoken @arabic`) in monospace, or _Default — no override_ italic muted when neither is set; reads live from `ui-store` so it updates as the user navigates tabs. Frank cleared both rounds. Merged at `3902613`.
- **PR #108 / #102 — AlertDialogAction sweep.** All five remaining destructive-confirm dialogs (`language-selector` Unpublish + Delete, `mode-selector` Unpublish + Delete, `user-memory-dialog` ClearMemoryButton) now use plain `<Button>` + controlled-dialog state + manual close on success, matching the `admin-users.tsx` precedent from PR #100. Policy extracted as `runConfirmedAction` in `src/lib/run-confirmed-action.ts` — 6 unit tests pin the contract (happy path, rejection → no onSuccess, Error.message extraction, non-Error fallback, default fallback, temporal ordering). Parent callback signatures changed to `Promise<void>` so dialogs can await; `mutateAsync` adopted in `languages.tsx` and `manual-config.tsx`. **Frank P2:** the synchronous-fire Publish button (no confirmation dialog) was calling `void onSetPublished(...)` — `void` doesn't catch a rejection, so a failed publish bubbled as an unhandled promise rejection. Fixed in `1197608` with explicit `.catch(() => {})` matching pre-PR silent-failure behavior. Frank re-reviewed clean. Merged at `65d69b5`.
- **Upstream PR: `unfoldingWord/uw-dev-skills#1` — local-date session conventions.** Surfaced when wrapping up: the SOD/EOD/progress templates implicitly assumed `date` in the shell, but `uw-sandbox` reports UTC so evening sessions could create a duplicate next-day tracker entry. Updated all three command templates to (a) use the user-local date from the system prompt's `currentDate` field and (b) document the multi-session-per-day convention (append qualifier `morning`/`afternoon`/`evening`/`late-evening` rather than duplicate top-level date heading). Merged.

**In Progress:**

- None — all four PRs merged.

**Blockers:**

- **bt-servant-worker#201** (Strip Ulysses-style comments at prompt assembly) — only remaining open worker blocker; gates portal #77 backend half. Portal #77 visual-highlighting half remains paused on Ian's editor-library decision.

**Frank review patterns surfaced this session:**

- **Cite the SHA you reviewed.** Two reviews this session bit on stale code — Frank cited line numbers from an older commit while CI ran against a newer one. Both resolved by re-running review against the fix SHA. The fix → re-review cycle works as long as the SHA the reviewer cites is named explicitly.
- **`mutateAsync` rejection handling.** Switching from `mutate` to `mutateAsync` is not free — `void` operator suppresses no-floating-promises lint but does NOT catch the rejection. Any sync-fire caller of an async callback needs an explicit `.catch()`, or it'll show up as an unhandled promise rejection in production console.

**Patterns / decisions captured today:**

- **Tests under `tests/` can pull from `src/` via `@/*` path mapping in `tsconfig.worker.json`.** Added the path mapping so `tests/chat-api.test.ts`, `tests/languages-api.test.ts`, etc. can `import { applyTriggerPrefix } from "@/lib/chat-api"`. Transitively-imported `src/` modules typecheck under worker tsconfig as long as they only use Web/Worker types (no DOM, no JSX). Lives in `tsconfig.worker.json:32-35`.
- **`runConfirmedAction` is the canonical destructive-dialog policy.** Single helper in `src/lib/run-confirmed-action.ts` owns the "clear error → await → close on success, set error and stay open on failure" lifecycle. All five destructive-confirm dialogs call it identically; future destructive UIs should reuse it rather than re-implementing.
- **Worker contract validation: static analysis suffices when both sides are source-readable.** The Languages CRUD + scaffold endpoint contracts were validated by reading worker `src/index.ts` head + portal client code, without live curl. Worker has 572 tests + Ian designed the endpoints to match portal calls. Net cost: ~10 minutes; net value: high confidence to start building. Live smoke can come pre-demo.
- **The `#mode @language` trigger lives entirely in the message text.** No new wire field on the chat endpoint. Worker classifier extracts tokens deterministically (3-tier cascade: exact → unique prefix → unique Levenshtein ≤ 2; worker #211 / PR #212), strips both matched and unmatched tokens before history, and routes unmatched to the orchestrator's system prompt for a contextual "did you mean…" reply. Portal-side: just prepend `#<mode> @<lang>` to the outgoing message.
- **Local user date for session entries, not container `date`.** `uw-sandbox`'s system clock often reports UTC; during local-evening sessions that's tomorrow's date. SOD/EOD/progress templates and memory entry `feedback_local_date_for_sessions.md` now codify: read from system prompt's `currentDate`, append session-qualified sub-entries for same-day continuation rather than duplicate date headings.

**Next Steps:**

- **#76 — Replace six-box mode editor with markdown editor + TOC.** Now unblocked (worker #213 shipped today). This is the load-bearing piece left for the June 9 demo path — once it lands, `#spoken @arabic` end-to-end works from the new editor. Pairs with #82 (portal-side mode data migration) which is also unblocked.
- **#82 — Mode data migration (portal side).** Companion to worker #213. Worker now synthesizes markdown on GET (`format: "markdown"` + `originalSlots` for diagnostics) and tolerates both shapes on PUT — portal just needs the editor wire-up.
- **#77 visual half** — still paused on Ian's editor-library decision. Continue waiting.
- **Backlog tech debt** when major Epic #72 demo path is in place: **#99** (password-reset session invalidation), **#91** (Node 24 actions bump).

### 2026-05-11 (evening) — Mode markdown editor shipped; retrospective audit + cleanup batch

**Context entering the session:** Worker #213 had just shipped Phase 1 mode migration earlier in the day; this evening session implemented the consumer side end-to-end, then ran a retrospective audit of the past 5 days of work and shipped 4 follow-up PRs from the findings.

**Completed:**

- **PR #110 / #76 + #82 — Mode markdown editor + TOC.** New `/modes` page mirrors the `languages.tsx` pattern (selector toolbar + `MarkdownToc` + `MarkdownEditor` + `lastSyncedDoc` autosave + pending-switch guards). `PromptMode.overrides` removed from the portal type per #82's "no legacy slot-map awareness" AC. `useSetModePublished` dropped — the new worker contract requires `document` on every PUT, so publish/unpublish goes through `useSaveMode` with the full body (mirrors `useSaveLanguage`). Existing `/prompt-configuration` route stripped to org-overrides-only and renamed "Prompt Overrides" in the sidebar with a new `faSliders` icon (Modes takes the `faPenToSquare` slot). Canonical 7-section H2 scaffold at `src/lib/mode-scaffold.ts` mirrors the worker's `toMarkdownView` synthesis for an empty mode so GET → PUT → GET is identity-clean. Drive-by: `putMode` now unwraps `{ org, mode, message }` envelope — third instance of the `putLanguage` / `putMode` pattern (the latent `putOrgOverrides` instance was caught in the audit immediately after).
- **Retrospective audit of the 2026-05-07 → 2026-05-11 PR stretch.** Two parallel subagents — one for test-coverage gaps, one for latent-bug / missed-piece hunting. Findings synthesized into 9 issues: #112 (server-side authz hole on config mutations), #113 (`putOrgOverrides` envelope), #114 (silent save errors), #115 (createAdminUser password floor), #116 (UI selection leak across logins), #117 (chat-stream user_id ownership — deferred), #118 / #119 / #120 (test backfills). Codex/Frank confirmed the audit + reframed #111 (originally filed as UI-only) as the surface-side of #112's load-bearing server-side authz gap.
- **PR #121 / #112 + #111 + #115 — Worker authz + password policy.** `worker/config.ts` now 403s non-admins on PUT/DELETE for both `/api/config/modes/{name}` and `/api/config/prompt-overrides`. `/modes` + `/prompt-configuration` wrapped in `<RequireAdmin>`. Sidebar entries gated on `isAdmin`. `mode-selector.tsx` "New Mode" + Delete buttons gated. `validatePasswordPolicy` (8 ≤ len ≤ 128) applied to `createUser` + `updateUser`. **Frank P2 fix `22ba60b`:** `updateUser` switched to `body.password !== undefined` so an empty-string admin reset doesn't silently no-op. 10 new tests in new `tests/config-authz.test.ts` + 7 new in `tests/admin-auth.test.ts`. Merged at `69d033b`.
- **PR #122 / #113 + #114 + #116 — UX cleanup cluster.** `putOrgOverrides` envelope unwrap (third instance of the pattern, with a shared `unwrapOverridesResponse` helper). "Save failed: …" banner on modes + manual-config + languages pages (with `genericMutationError` filter on languages to separate from the existing forbidden-error banner). `useAuth.login` calls `resetUi()` symmetrically with logout. Modes page got a defensive useEffect parallel to languages.tsx:207-211 that drops a stale `selectedMode`. **Frank P2 fix `09a6b0c`:** autosave previously retried indefinitely on a failed save (`isPending` flip re-fired the effect). New `lastFailedDoc` state pauses autosave for the same draft until the user edits further or clicks Save manually; clears on success or selection change. Applied symmetrically to languages.tsx and modes.tsx. 8 new tests for `getOrgOverrides` / `putOrgOverrides`. Merged at `89d3c90`.
- **PR #123 / #118 + #119 — High-value test backfill.** `tests/permissions.test.ts` (18 tests) pins the trinary back-compat (`undefined` / `"*"` / `string[]`) on `hasLanguageRights`, `hasAnyLanguageRights`, `filterAuthorizedLanguages` — the sole portal-side language gate in the trusted-portal model. `tests/markdown-headings.test.ts` (18 tests) pins the four-state suppression machine (fence + paragraph comment + inline span + slug uniqueness) plus a combined-state regression. Merged at `92cfdf4`.
- **PR #124 / #120 — API client test backfill.** `tests/admin-users-api.test.ts` (15 tests, new file) — entire `admin-users-api.ts` was untested; pins the 403-vs-other-4xx error-class branching that the UI dialogs depend on, URL-encoding on email path params, non-JSON error body resilience. Added `listModes` / `deleteMode` / `getUserMemory` / `deleteUserMemory` / `setUserMode` / `clearUserMode` coverage (15 new) — including a **load-bearing body-shape assertion** that `setUserMode` sends `{ mode }` not `{ name }` (easy mis-refactor since the function param is named `mode`). Added `listLanguages` / `getLanguage` / `deleteLanguage` coverage (11 new) — pins the `operation` discriminant (`read` / `delete`) on `LanguageForbiddenError`. Rebased on main during merge to resolve a `tests/config-api.test.ts` conflict with PR #122; merged at `f19f798`.
- **Issue #125 filed:** Remove Prompt Overrides — per Elsy (Epic owner) + Christou ("we're essentially merging those squares into one big square"). The split-into-two-pages choice from PR #110 was transitional; the Epic's intent was full replacement. Phase 1 (hide sidebar entry) is small and matches Elsy's explicit ask; Phase 2 (delete page + worker BFF route + upstream worker endpoint) needs Ian's confirmation on whether the worker still consumes `/api/v1/admin/orgs/{org}/prompt-overrides` at chat time.

**In Progress:**

- None code-wise. #125 will be picked up in a fresh session.

**Blockers:**

- **#125 Phase 2** awaits Ian's confirmation on worker consumption of `/api/v1/admin/orgs/{org}/prompt-overrides` at chat time.
- **#77 visual half** — still on Ian's editor-library decision (CodeMirror 6 tentative).

**Frank review patterns surfaced this session:**

- **Subagents catch bug clusters humans miss.** Two parallel subagents (one test-coverage, one latent-bug) produced 9 actionable issues from the 5-day stretch in ~5 minutes wall-clock. The latent-bug agent specifically caught the `putOrgOverrides` envelope-unwrap bug (third instance of a pattern I'd already fixed twice in `putLanguage` / `putMode`) — the kind of "I should have spotted this when writing it" miss that retrospective audits exist to catch.
- **The "hammered-API retry" autosave failure mode.** Frank's PR-122 P2 — TanStack's `error` clears on each retry's `pending` phase, so a failing autosave both hammers the upstream API and flickers the error banner. The fix pattern (track `lastFailedDoc` separately; gate autosave on `debouncedDraft !== lastFailedDoc`; clear on edit or manual retry) is reusable for any optimistic-mutation UI.
- **GitHub `Closes #N` only auto-closes the FIRST issue in a comma-list.** PR-body syntax `Closes #112, #111, #115` closed only #112 on merge — the others stayed open and needed manual closure at EOD. Captured in `feedback_gh_closes_keyword.md`. Workaround: repeat the keyword (`Closes #112, closes #111, closes #115`) or one-per-line.

**Patterns / decisions captured today (evening):**

- **Server-side authz is load-bearing; UI gates are defense-in-depth.** Per the trusted-portal model (worker holds the upstream admin token; engine has zero user identity), the portal worker is the only enforcement point. PR #110 added UI button gates on mode-selector, but PR #121 surfaced that the worker itself was happily proxying any authenticated session's PUT/DELETE. Both layers now exist; route `<RequireAdmin>` is the third backstop. Frank's framing was right: "UI gating without server gating is theater with a lint-friendly costume."
- **Canonical mode scaffold matches the worker's synthesizer.** New modes open with all 7 H2 sections (`## Identity`, `## Teaching Methodology`, …) populated empty — matches what the worker emits via `toMarkdownView` for a slotted mode with empty bodies, so round-trip GET → PUT → GET is identity-clean at the section level. Constant lives at `src/lib/mode-scaffold.ts`.
- **`lastFailedDoc` autosave gate.** Track failed-save drafts separately from `lastSyncedDoc`; pause autosave when `debouncedDraft === lastFailedDoc`; clear on success, selection change, or further edit. Without this, a 4xx-failing save retries on every `isPending → false` and hammers the API. Pattern in `src/app/pages/{languages,modes}.tsx`.
- **GitHub `Closes` keyword is non-list-aware.** Captured as memory. Future PRs that close multiple issues should repeat the keyword.

**Next Steps:**

- **#125 — Remove (or hide) Prompt Overrides** is the highest-leverage next pick. Phase 1 (hide sidebar entry, ~3-line PR) matches Elsy's explicit ask and unblocks the Epic's "merging squares into one big square" intent. Phase 2 needs Ian for worker consumption check first.
- **#77 backend half is now unblocked** (worker #201 closed today) but the visual half still awaits Ian's editor-library decision.
- **Tech debt backlog**: **#99** (password-reset session invalidation), **#91** (Node 24 actions bump), **#117** (chat-stream `user_id` ownership — needs design call).
- The Epic #72 demo path (`#spoken @arabic` end-to-end through the new editor) is now functionally complete; June 9 demo is in good shape with #77 visual-highlighting as the only optional polish remaining.

### 2026-05-11 (late-evening) — #125 Phase 1 + worker companion filed + #99 shipped

**Context entering the session:** Started as a continuation of the evening session (per local-date convention). Frank had cleared PR #126 but flagged a P2 on stale "engine" terminology in the #125 references. The natural next pick from the evening's Next Steps was Phase 1 of #125 (sidebar hide), then #99 (password reset session invalidation).

**Completed:**

- **PR #126 follow-up — Frank P2 fix on tracker terminology.** Six occurrences of stale "engine" wording in the #125 roadmap text replaced with "worker / upstream worker endpoint / worker consumption" to match the project's actual architecture (engine dormant since 2026-01-16; ENGINE_BASE_URL var points at bt-servant-worker). Path corrected from `/api/config/prompt-overrides` (portal BFF) to `/api/v1/admin/orgs/{org}/prompt-overrides` (worker upstream) in the AC line that specifically refers to chat-time consumption. Audited closed Epic #72 sub-issues (#79, #80, #81, #82, #96) — all still contain "engine" references but they're accurate historical artifacts from before the 2026-05-08 refile audit; left untouched per Seth. Issue #125's body also patched for the same drift (7 lines). Merged at `8dd4f96` after Frank re-approved.
- **PR #127 / #125 Phase 1 — Hide Prompt Overrides sidebar entry.** Matches Elsy's exact ask ("hide Prompt Overrides from the Menu"). Single-file change: removed the `<ActivityBarItem>` block + `faSliders` light/solid imports in `src/components/activity-bar.tsx`. `/prompt-configuration` route + `worker/config.ts` proxy + `"prompt-configuration"` UI section entry + `use-sync-section` mapping all preserved deliberately as an emergency URL escape during the transition. Frank approved no findings (1 file, 14 deletions). Merged at `a39954f`.
- **Worker companion issue filed: bt-servant-worker#215.** Pre-emptively investigated whether Phase 2 was safe before proceeding. Two parallel Explore agents traced the chat pipeline in `/workspace/bt-servant-worker` and surfaced that the worker still consumes org-level overrides on **every** chat request: `readAllOrgKV` (`src/index.ts:832–838`) → DO body injection at line 943 → `resolvePromptOverrides(orgOverrides, modeOverrides, userOverrides)` (`user-do.ts:1088–1090`) → all 7 slots concatenated into `buildSystemPrompt` (`system-prompt.ts:204–228`). Filed bt-servant-worker#215 with a 5-step migration plan: ~10-line worker patch (drop the KV read; pass `{}` to resolver), the existing hardcoded `DEFAULT_PROMPT_VALUES` (`bt-servant-worker/src/types/prompt-overrides.ts:104–160`) as the safe fall-through, KV inventory commands, and a clean architectural alignment note (Ian's commit `0a7edc8` already removed the parallel `defaultMode` concept). Pre-flight KV inventory came back empty (zero non-`:modes` keys in both staging `1416f321fbda450095214111d38d211a` and prod `c1828624ab434f079776bddd171882d9`) — worker patch will be invisible to all orgs. Cross-link comment on portal #125 with revised 5-phase sequence (worker patch → soak → portal Phase 2 → KV cleanup no-op → worker admin-route cleanup). Phase 2 in this repo paused pending #215. Seth confirmed his scope is admin-portal only and Ian handles worker work; I'm not authoring the worker PR.
- **PR #128 / #99 — Admin password reset invalidates target sessions.** Closes the "reset password but the old cookie keeps working" gap on `PUT /api/admin/users/{email}`. Extracted `invalidateUserSessions(env, targetEmail, exceptSessionId?)` helper in `worker/auth.ts` — pagination over `session:*`, filter by stored email, optional skip, **awaits all deletes** before returning (fixed a latent fire-and-forget bug in the existing `handleChangePassword` pattern in the process). Plumbing: `getSessionId` now exported from `auth.ts`; `AdminScope.org` gains `selfSessionId: string | null` populated by `requireAdminAuth` so the cookie-path admin can preserve their current tab when resetting their own password; X-Admin-Secret CLI has no caller session by design. `updateUser` only invalidates when `body.password !== undefined` (PUTs that just touch name/role/language_rights leave sessions intact). Frontend: re-introduced the password field in `AdminUserEditDialog` per AC #4 (was pulled in PR #100 pending this fix) with hint text adapting to self vs other ("this tab keeps working" vs "share the new password out-of-band"). 6 new worker tests covering the matrix; 160/160 across full suite. Frank approved no findings. Merged at `fbadf98`.

**In Progress:**

- None code-wise.

**Blockers:**

- **bt-servant-worker#215** — gates portal #125 Phase 2. Ian's queue; no portal-side action available.
- **#77 visual highlighting half** — still paused on Ian's editor-library decision (CodeMirror 6 tentative).

**Frank review patterns surfaced this session:**

- **One clean pass per PR.** Three PRs this session (#126, #127, #128); all approved on first review with no findings. The PR descriptions were thorough and tightly scoped, which seems to be doing a lot of the work — Frank flags less when the PR is already "reading like it's been reviewed."
- **Sub-agent pre-flight prevents Frank P2s.** Before opening the worker companion PR (which I ultimately didn't author per scope), I ran two parallel Explore agents to verify Phase 2 was safe. The investigation surfaced the chat-pipeline consumption that the #125 issue's own AC gate clause anticipated but the user's "Ian said proceed" had verbally cleared. Catching that _before_ opening a PR (instead of after Frank flags it) saved a review round.

**Patterns / decisions captured today (late-evening):**

- **`Closes #N` fires regardless of prose qualifier.** PR #127's body said `Closes #125 only partially — Phase 2 stays open` and GitHub auto-closed #125 anyway. The "only partially" wording is invisible to GitHub's keyword parser. Reopened with explanation. Compounds with the earlier "Closes is non-list-aware" gotcha — combined rule: if you don't want a PR to auto-close an issue, **omit the keyword entirely** (use "Tracks #N" or "Related to #N"). Captured in updated memory.
- **Cross-repo deletion sequencing.** When the portal needs to retire a feature whose data is consumed by the worker, the right sequence is: (1) verify pre-flight inventory of the storage namespace; (2) file a PR-ready issue in the worker repo with a migration patch sketch; (3) wait for the worker to stop consuming; (4) only then delete the portal-side editing surface. Trying to delete the portal-side surface first strands the storage as un-editable hidden state still influencing chat. Encoded as project decision under #125's sequence.
- **`invalidateUserSessions` helper and the fire-and-forget bug.** Cloudflare Workers don't guarantee unawaited promises complete after a response is returned. The existing `handleChangePassword` built up `deletePromises` and never awaited them — deletes were best-effort. The new helper always awaits before returning. Latency cost is proportional to total session count for that email and is acceptable for low-frequency endpoints (admin password reset, self change-password).
- **Scope = admin-portal only across the bt-servant family.** Seth's coding duties are scoped to bt-servant-admin-portal; Ian handles work in sibling repos (worker, engine, etc.). Even when a cross-repo change is technically clear-cut, file a PR-ready issue in the sibling repo with crosslinks rather than switching directories. Encoded as memory `feedback_scope_admin_portal_only`.

**Next Steps:**

- **bt-servant-worker#215** — wait for Ian. Once that lands and soaks, portal #125 Phase 2 PR opens here (full deletion of `manual-config.tsx`, `prompt-panel.tsx`, the `/prompt-configuration` route, the `/api/config/prompt-overrides` branch in `worker/config.ts`, the three org-overrides functions in `config-api.ts`, `useOrgOverrides`/`useUpdateOrgOverrides` hooks, the `"prompt-configuration"` section entry, and ~12 tests). The Phase 2 PR also can't blindly delete `src/types/prompt-override.ts` — `mode-scaffold.ts` still imports `PROMPT_SLOTS` and `SLOT_LABELS` for the modes scaffold; only the org-overrides exports become dead.
- **#91 — Node 24 actions bump** — surfaced as a deprecation annotation on every CI run today; time-bound to Sep 16 2026 hard removal but not urgent. Mechanical fix.
- **README cleanup** — Frank flagged a stale `/manual-config` table entry on PR #127 (pre-existing drift from PR #110). Small docs PR.
- **#117 — chat-stream `user_id` ownership** — still waiting on a design call.

### 2026-05-13 — Issue triage + cleanup batch (Node 24, dark mode, chat panes); 19-day prod promotion

**Context entering the session:** SOD opened with PR #129 (the 2026-05-11 late-evening progress tracker) sitting unmerged with green CI. Three Next-Step items from the late-evening session were unblocked: README cleanup (Frank P2), #91 Node 24 actions bump, and (newly surfaced) a triage of open portal issues against the Epic #72 pivot to see what was actually still live vs superseded.

**Completed:**

- **PR #130 — README drift cleanup.** Three small drifts in one focused docs PR: Pages table dropped the `/manual-config` row (no longer in the sidebar; Phase 2 deletes the page) and added the three actually-reachable surfaces (`/modes`, `/languages`, `/admin/users`) with their access gates; `worker/config.ts` architecture-diagram comment now mentions languages (added in PR #92); Worker BFF Routes table fixed dual-auth on `/api/admin/*` ("Admin secret or session" per the 2026-05-08 retrospective audit) and replaced the stale "Prompt overrides, modes, default mode" with "Modes, languages, prompt overrides" (default mode removed in worker #211 / PR #212). Frank cleared no findings. Merged at `ff8046e`.
- **PR #129 — late-evening progress tracker merged** at `eebd3e6`. (User-instructed merge after CI cleared; no Frank review needed for a docs-only PR.)
- **PR #131 / #91 — Node 24 actions bump.** Cleared the runner-side "Node.js 20 actions are deprecated" annotation that had fired on every CI run since the staging-on-merge rewire (PR #90, 2026-05-08). Bumped `actions/checkout@v4 → @v6`, `actions/setup-node@v4 → @v6`, `actions/github-script@v7 → @v8` (one major below v9 to avoid the `require('@actions/github')` ESM break which our scripts don't trigger but tightens surface for future edits), `actions/upload-artifact@v4 → @v6` (skipped v7's opt-in direct-upload feature we don't use). `gitleaks/gitleaks-action@v2` stays — no v3 exists and `action.yml` is explicitly `using: "node20"` — workaround per the issue's escape-hatch note: `FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24: "true"` env on the `secret-scan` job with an inline comment flagging the workaround as transitional. Validated end-to-end: 3 of 4 CI jobs have zero deprecation annotations after the bump; the 4th (secret-scan) has only the expected transitional "being forced to run on Node.js 24: gitleaks/gitleaks-action@v2" warning. Merged at `5a9d1c8`.
- **Issue triage batch — 7 issues closed as superseded-by-pivot.** Audited the 26 open portal issues against the #125 Phase 2 + Epic #72 pivot. Closed 7 with clear pivot reasoning:
  - **#67** (prompt config card buttons overflow), **#55** (resizable expanded editor), **#54** (default size of expanded editor), **#51** (mobile tap-to-expand spec) — all on the dying `/prompt-configuration` surface (#125 Phase 1 hid the sidebar; Phase 2 deletes the page entirely).
  - **#9 + #10** (slot color tokens in `prompt-panel.tsx`) — that file is only imported by `manual-config.tsx`; deleted with the page in #125 Phase 2.
  - **#18** (`.config-grid-bg` off-system value) — only consumed by `manual-config.tsx`; same gate. Caught during the dark-mode PR triage and folded into the same pivot bucket.
- **Catalog comment on #59 (Benjamin's ideas)** — left open as backlog reference. Cataloged: "fewer categories" + "one box" ✅ done via #110's single-document editor; "glossary table" still live as a portal-side backlog feature (post-Epic #72); "skill use" / "progressive disclosure" / "prompt caching" are worker-scope (defer for Ian's worker backlog).
- **Dark mode polish umbrella — #133 filed.** Grouped the 7 surviving dark-mode issues into a single design-pass epic so the token audit could be done cohesively. Scope: #11, #12, #13, #14, #16, #18, #19. Updated #133 down to **6 issues** when #18 turned out to be on the dying surface.
- **Epic #72 body updated.** Added a Status section listing all 9 shipped sub-issues + 3 remaining (#125 Phase 2, #77, **language-file loading via bt-servant-worker#191**). Surfaced bt-servant-worker#191 as the **fifth Goal's DoD blocker** — previously invisible in the epic body. Cross-repo dependency table at the bottom: worker #215 ↔ #125 Phase 2; worker #191 ↔ language loading; (not filed) ↔ #77 visual-highlight.
- **PR #134 / #133 — Dark mode polish in one design pass.** Six issues addressed coherently:
  - **#14** foreground chroma — bumped 6 `.dark` foreground tokens (`--foreground`, `--card-foreground`, `--popover-foreground`, `--secondary-foreground`, `--muted-foreground`, `--sidebar-foreground`) from zero-chroma neutral grey to hue 248, chroma 0.008 (below visible-tint threshold; "warmth without coloring"). `--accent-foreground` and `--sidebar-accent-foreground` left at pure white intentionally.
  - **#12** activity bar hover — added `dark:hover:bg-white/[0.08]` so the hover delta exceeds the perceptibility threshold. Light mode still uses `hover:bg-accent`.
  - **#13** active nav background — added `bg-primary/8 dark:bg-primary/12` to the active branch so the signal doesn't ride entirely on the 2px primary strip + a small text-color delta.
  - **#16** activity bar shadow — added `dark:shadow-[2px_0_12px_rgba(0,0,0,0.35)]` so the side shadow punches through the darker ambient surface.
  - **#11** mode + language selector icon backgrounds — bumped `bg-primary/10` to `dark:bg-primary/20` in both `mode-selector.tsx` and `language-selector.tsx`. The issue body noted both surfaces.
  - **#19** destructive button — dropped `dark:bg-destructive/60` alpha modifier. The dark-mode `--destructive` token is already a hand-picked darker red (`oklch(0.637 0.237 25)` vs light-mode `oklch(0.577 0.245 27.325)`); adding `/60` on top was a double-mute. Kept the `dark:focus-visible:ring-destructive/40` ring tweak (unrelated to body fill).
  - Frank flagged three process/metadata items on the first review: commit author (declined — `CLAUDE.md` says Claude is author; `AGENTS.md` is symmetric for Codex's own commits), past-tense "deleted" wording on out-of-scope items (fixed — changed to "scheduled for deletion in Phase 2"), and `closingIssuesReferences: []` because the "## Closes" header + bare `#N` bullets aren't recognized as keywords (fixed — `Closes #N` per line; verified post-edit via `gh pr view --json closingIssuesReferences` that all 7 references parse). All 4 CI checks green. Merged at `99da477`.
- **PR #135 / chat panes cleanup — three issues bundled.** Net **−185 lines** across 6 modified files + 1 new hook (+51 lines):
  - **#31** typing-animation removal — deleted `src/hooks/use-animated-text.ts` entirely (was animating at 2 chars / 16ms ≈ 125 chars/sec, slower than the real SSE token rate). `AnimatedText` component collapsed into a direct Markdown render in `AssistantMessage`; streaming cursor pulse kept for the live-stream affordance. Cascade cleanup in both `useTestChat` and `useBaruchChat`: `isCompleting` state, `pendingCompleteRef`, `finalizeComplete` callback, and the two-branch `hadStreaming` finalization all dead without animation — removed. Pane components no longer destructure or pass any of `isCompleting` / `onAnimationCaughtUp` / `finalizeComplete`.
  - **#50** input dedup — extracted `useChatInput({ onSubmit, isBusy })` to `src/hooks/use-chat-input.ts`. Owns `input` state, `inputRef`, `handleSubmit`, `handleKeyDown` (Enter without Shift), and busy→idle focus restoration. Both panes lost ~25 lines each of duplicated state + handlers. Auto-scroll effect (5 lines, identical deps in both panes) left inlined — extracting it would require an `eslint-disable react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` for a passed deps array; cost > benefit.
  - **#48** stable React keys — wrapped `normalizeChildren`'s array `.map()` output in `<Fragment key={index}>`. Position-based keys are stable because react-markdown produces a deterministic child order from the parsed markdown tree.
  - Frank cleared no medium+ issues. Residual risk noted: no React-hook test infrastructure in this repo (vitest-pool-workers is workerd-only, no DOM); manual smoke is the meaningful validation for cursor pulse, focus restore, Enter vs Shift+Enter, and Baruch initiation. Merged at `25ea9c1`.
- **Prod promotion — 19-day batch.** Elsy approved staging at 14:45 local. Triggered `Deploy Production` workflow dispatch on `main` at HEAD `25ea9c1`. **33 commits accumulated since the last prod deploy (2026-04-24)** — basically the entire Epic #72 ship (markdown editor + TOC for modes and languages, Languages tab + CRUD, Users admin, brand context accents, language scaffold preload, test chat trigger wiring, AlertDialogAction sweep, admin authz tightening, password reset session invalidation, Prompt Overrides Phase 1) plus the CI tech-debt (Node 22, Node 24 actions, per-PR workers, staging-on-merge) plus today's dark-mode + chat-panes work. Workflow has a built-in CI re-gate (typecheck + lint + build + npm audit) before the wrangler deploy.
- **Frank-collaboration patterns surfaced this session:**
  - **Cross-agent author convention.** `CLAUDE.md` says Claude is author for Claude's commits; `AGENTS.md` says Codex is author for Codex's commits. Each rule applies to its own agent. Frank misread this on PR #134 round 1; pushed back with explicit reasoning and added a "Reviewer notes" section to PR #135's body so the convention is visible on future PRs. Memory `team_frank_reviewer` updated to capture this.
  - **GitHub auto-close keyword discipline.** The "## Closes" header + bare `#N` bullets pattern doesn't trip GitHub's parser. Must be `Closes #N` per line (or comma-list with repeated keyword, but that's verbose). Verified empirically via `gh pr view --json closingIssuesReferences` after each PR-body edit. Encoded as part of the existing memory `feedback_gh_closes_keyword`.

**Day rollup:**

**5 PRs merged, 11 issues auto-closed, 7 issues closed in triage (#9, #10, #18, #51, #54, #55, #67), 1 umbrella issue filed (#133), 1 issue body refresh (Epic #72), 1 backlog catalog comment (#59).**

Open portal issue count: **26 → 10**. Remaining: #28 (deep links), #49 (field-sizing tracker), #56 + #57 (User Memory viewer), #52 + #53 (perf nits), #59 (Benjamin catch-all), #72 (Epic), #77 + #117 + #125 (gated).

**In Progress:**

- None code-wise. Prod promotion landed successfully (run `25822043201`, CI Gate 42s + Deploy 41s = ~83s wall-clock).

**Blockers:**

- **bt-servant-worker#215** — gates portal #125 Phase 2. Ian's queue; no movement since the 2026-05-11 pre-flight KV inventory comment.
- **bt-servant-worker#191** — gates Epic #72's fifth Goal (dynamic language-file loading). Now surfaced in the Epic #72 body. Ian's queue.
- **#77 visual highlighting** — still paused on Ian's editor-library decision (CodeMirror 6 tentative).
- **#117** — chat-stream `user_id` ownership; awaiting design call.

**Patterns / decisions captured today:**

- **Pre-filing triage prevents wasted umbrella scope.** Filed dark-mode umbrella #133 with 7 sub-issues; during the implementation PR triage discovered #18 was on the dying `.config-grid-bg` surface (same pivot as #9/#10). Closed #18, narrowed umbrella to 6, updated body. Lesson: when scoping an umbrella/epic, run a quick file-usage check against any known dying surfaces before listing sub-issues — saves a "wait, that's not actually in scope" revision later.
- **GitHub `closingIssuesReferences` is the truth.** Don't trust prose. After every PR body edit that includes issue-closing references, run `gh pr view <N> --json closingIssuesReferences` to confirm the parser picked them up. The `## Closes` header pattern doesn't trip auto-close even though it reads as obvious intent.
- **Cross-agent author convention is real.** `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` have parallel rules: each agent's instruction file specifies its own author. Frank/Codex reads AGENTS.md and may flag Claude's author on review — declining is the correct response with an explicit reference to the cross-agent convention.
- **No-test-infra ≠ no-tests-needed.** Per `feedback_real_tests`, pure functions with discrete edge cases need a `.test.ts`. But React hooks aren't pure functions; the chat-panes cleanup PR didn't add new pure functions (only extracted a React hook, `useChatInput`); no testing-library setup exists in this repo (vitest-pool-workers is workerd-only). Manual smoke is the meaningful validation path. Frank's residual-risk note correctly identifies the gap but it's structural, not actionable in a follow-up PR.

**Next Steps:**

- **PR 4 — User Memory enhancements** (next in proposed sequence): #56 (auto-load admin's own memory), #57 (UUID-to-email dropdown), #53 (TextEncoder allocation perf). All touch `user-memory-dialog.tsx`. #57 likely needs a worker companion for the UUID→email mapping API; investigate before scoping.
- **PR 5 — Deep link mode slugs** (#28): React Router resolver for `/<mode-slug>` → activate mode + redirect to `/modes`. Cross-repo overlap with worker #137 — close one as duplicate (portal-owning is more natural since URL routing is portal-side).
- **PR 6 — Shell perf nit** (#52): one-line `useEffect` cleanup. Micro-PR.
- **Watch for worker movement**: Ian on bt-servant-worker#215 + #191. Once #215 lands and soaks, portal #125 Phase 2 PR opens here (full deletion of `manual-config.tsx`, `prompt-panel.tsx`, the `/prompt-configuration` route, the `/api/config/prompt-overrides` branch in `worker/config.ts`, the three org-overrides functions in `config-api.ts`, `useOrgOverrides`/`useUpdateOrgOverrides` hooks, the `"prompt-configuration"` section entry, the `.config-grid-bg` CSS class, and ~12 tests).

## Known Issues

- **#117 — `/api/chat/stream` accepts arbitrary `user_id` from session-cookied users.** Worker validates UUIDv4 shape but not ownership; a logged-in user could submit another user's test-chat UUID. Discovery requires knowing/guessing a v4 — hard but not impossible (logs / screen-share / copy-paste). Deferred from 2026-05-11 retrospective batch pending a design call between (1) namespacing test-chat UUIDs as `test:<session.userId>:<uuid>`, (2) requiring `isAdmin` for cross-user UUIDs, or (3) KV-tracked session→testChatUserId.
- **#125 — Prompt Overrides removal (in flight).** Phase 1 shipped 2026-05-11 (sidebar entry hidden). Phase 2 (full removal of page + BFF route + types) gated on bt-servant-worker#215 stopping the chat-time consumption of org-level prompt-overrides. Pre-flight KV inventory clear in both staging and prod.

## Architectural Decisions

Track ADRs under `docs/adr/` if/when needed.

Notable decisions made 2026-05-07 (captured here pending ADRs):

- **Ulysses comment syntax** — Mode and language documents use `%%` (paragraph comment) and `++…++` (paired inline span), verbatim Ulysses convention per Tim Jore. Source: [help.ulysses.app](https://help.ulysses.app/en_US/comments-notes-annotations).
- **Per-PR deploy pattern** — Each PR deploys to `bt-servant-admin-portal-pr-<N>`, auto-deleted on close. `wrangler delete --force` is required for non-interactive runs (per Frank review).
- **Trigger-syntax parsing** — `#<mode> @<language>` should be parsed using BT Servant's existing prompt-driven intent classification pattern, not regex (per Ian).
- **Editor design direction** — "Outline-as-Index-Page": spine rail with Roman-numeral H2s and subordinate-rail H3s, active-section pin (`--editor-active`), warm-paper editor surface distinct from the chrome's neutral `--card`. Lives in `src/components/markdown-toc.tsx`.

Notable decisions made 2026-05-08:

- **Staging deploys are merge-event-driven, not CI-chained.** `deploy-staging.yml` triggers on `pull_request: closed + merged == true`, not `workflow_run` on CI. Direct provenance, surfaces under PR checks, comment-back on the merged PR. `workflow_dispatch` retained as the manual escape hatch.
- **Cache-vs-local-state pattern for autosave UIs.** When wiring autosave via React Query mutations, never use cache values (`query.data.x`) as the source of truth for dirty detection or post-save sync — the cache lags PUTs we just made. Track each saved-back field as separate local state advanced only on (a) initial sync at load/selection-change and (b) successful save with the value we sent. Pattern is in `src/app/pages/languages.tsx` for `lastSyncedDoc` + `lastSyncedPublished`.
- **`useBlocker` requires a data router.** When a feature needs `useBlocker`, loaders, or actions, the app must use `createBrowserRouter` + `RouterProvider`, not `<BrowserRouter>`. Migrated 2026-05-08 in PR #93.
- **Per-PR worker name as visible state.** Frank's review pattern: when a CI job comments back on a PR with a deployed URL or merge SHA, that comment is the artifact. Use it for both per-PR ephemeral workers (`deploy-pr.yml`) and the staging-on-merge deploy (`deploy-staging.yml`).
- **Languages are single-document, modes are slotted.** `Language { document: string }` vs `PromptMode { overrides: PromptOverrides }`. Reflected in: client signature, hooks (no `useSetLanguagePublished` partial-update hook because there's only one editable field), UI (single editor, no slot grid), engine contract (#206 mirrors #79).
- **Engine is a trusted-portal model.** Engine admin endpoints authenticate via a single shared `ADMIN_API_TOKEN` and extract zero user identity. Engine cannot enforce per-user authorization on admin paths. Any portal feature requiring per-user gating must be enforced in the portal worker before calling engine. Verified by reading engine code (`bt_servant_engine/.../dependencies.py`); engine companion #207 closed wontfix-by-design.
- **Live session hydration in `validateSession`.** Only `userId` + `createdAt` are session-immutable; everything else (email, name, org, isAdmin, language_rights) is derived from `StoredUser` on every authenticated request. Cost is one JSON parse (the KV read was already happening for the existence check). Means privilege grants/revocations and org moves take effect on the next request, not at 7-day session expiry.
- **Dual-auth on `/api/admin/users`.** `X-Admin-Secret` is the super-admin / CLI recovery path (cross-org, no CSRF check needed). Session-cookie + `isAdmin` is the browser path: org-scoped, requires `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest` for CSRF. Self-mutation guards (no self-delete, no self-demote) apply only to the cookie path so the secret remains a true recovery escape. Modeled as `AdminScope = { kind: "super" } | { kind: "org"; org; selfEmail }` threaded through all handlers.
- **`AlertDialogAction` is unsafe for async confirmations.** Radix's primitive auto-closes the dialog on click, dismissing inline error UI before `onError` callbacks fire. Use a plain destructive `<Button>` and close manually on `onSuccess`. Pattern fixed in `src/app/pages/admin-users.tsx` (PR #100); same anti-pattern still present in `src/components/language-selector.tsx` (sweep-worthy follow-up).
- **Worker test infrastructure pattern.** `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` + miniflare with bindings declared inline (`bindings`, `kvNamespaces`). `Cloudflare.Env` augmented in `worker/env.d.ts` to `extends WorkerEnv` so test code is fully typed and the binding interface stays single-sourced in `worker/helpers.ts`. Tests run in-process in workerd, ~500ms for the auth matrix.
- **The portal's API target is `bt-servant-worker`, not `bt-servant-engine`** (evening session). The env var `ENGINE_BASE_URL` is misleading — it points to `https://api.btservant.ai` which resolves to bt-servant-worker (Cloudflare Worker on Hono). bt-servant-engine (Python/FastAPI) is dormant since 2026-01-16 (last commit) — the CloudFlare Rebuild EPIC (engine #178, closed 2026-01-15) migrated all chat orchestration to the worker. Backend work for the portal lands in `bt-servant-worker`. The trusted-portal auth model previously attributed to "engine" is actually the worker's auth model — same conclusion (single shared admin token, no per-user identity on admin paths), correct repo.
- **Brand context accents (issue #78).** Mode-editing and language-editing surfaces share a `PageHeader` and would otherwise look identical. A 3px top accent strip — Inspire blue (`oklch(0.71 0.108 226)`) for Modes, Cultivate teal (`oklch(0.78 0.054 195)`) for Languages — gives at-a-glance context. Tokens live as `--brand-modes` / `--brand-languages` in `globals.css`. Variant-prop opt-in keeps neutral consumers (Baruch, Admin Users) untouched.

Notable decisions made 2026-05-11 (evening — retrospective batch):

- **Server-side authz is the load-bearing gate; UI gating is defense-in-depth.** Trusted-portal model means the worker holds the upstream admin token and the engine has zero user identity. `worker/config.ts` now 403s non-admins on PUT/DELETE for both `/api/config/modes/{name}` and `/api/config/prompt-overrides`. UI button gates + `<RequireAdmin>` route wrappers + sidebar-entry gates are belt-and-suspenders. GETs stay open because non-admin sessions still need to read modes for the test-chat trigger lookup.
- **Canonical mode scaffold matches worker synthesizer.** New mode documents open with all seven H2 sections (`## Identity` through `## Closing`) so that GET → PUT → GET is identity-clean at the section level vs. a not-yet-migrated slotted mode the worker synthesizes via `toMarkdownView`. Constant lives at `src/lib/mode-scaffold.ts`.
- **`lastFailedDoc` autosave gate.** Track failed-save drafts separately from `lastSyncedDoc`; pause autosave when `debouncedDraft === lastFailedDoc`; clear on success, selection change, or further edit. Without this, a 4xx-failing save retries on every `isPending → false` (TanStack clears `error` while pending, so the banner also flickers). Pattern in `src/app/pages/{languages,modes}.tsx`.
- **Password policy is centralized in `worker/admin.ts`.** `validatePasswordPolicy` (8 ≤ length ≤ 128) is used by both `createUser` and `updateUser` and mirrors `handleChangePassword` in `worker/auth.ts`. `updateUser`'s password branch uses `body.password !== undefined` (not truthy-check) so an empty-string admin reset rejects with the policy error rather than silently no-op'ing.
- **GitHub `Closes` keyword is per-token, not list-aware.** `Closes #A, #B, #C` only closes `#A`. Captured in memory; future multi-issue PR bodies must repeat the keyword (`Closes #A, closes #B, closes #C`) or use one-per-line.

Notable decisions made 2026-05-11:

- **`#mode @language` override is inline in the message text, not a wire field.** Final form of worker #199 (shipped via #211 / PR #212) is a deterministic 3-tier cascade (exact → unique prefix → unique Levenshtein ≤ 2) parsed from the leading tokens of the user message. The worker strips both matched and unmatched tokens before history, and routes unmatched tokens to the orchestrator's system prompt for a contextual "did you mean…" reply. Portal-side, the per-turn override is implemented by pre-pending `#<mode> @<lang>` to the outgoing message — `applyTriggerPrefix` in `src/lib/chat-api.ts`. No new field on the chat endpoint contract.
- **`runConfirmedAction` is the canonical destructive-confirmation policy.** Lives at `src/lib/run-confirmed-action.ts`. Owns the "clear error → await → close on success, set error and stay open on failure" lifecycle for any async destructive confirmation. Used by all five destructive-confirm dialogs in the app as of PR #108. Future destructive UI should reuse this helper rather than re-implementing the try/catch/state-machine inline.
- **Tests in `tests/` can import from `src/`.** `tsconfig.worker.json` now declares `"@/*": ["./src/*"]` so test files exercise pure functions and fetch-wrappers from the browser-side codebase using the project's standard alias. Transitively-pulled `src/` modules must stay free of DOM/JSX types for this to typecheck under the worker tsconfig (currently true for `src/types/chat`, `src/types/language*`, `src/lib/chat-api`, `src/lib/languages-api`, `src/lib/language-scaffold-api`).
- **Local user date for session tracking, not container `date`.** `uw-sandbox`'s system clock is UTC; during local-evening sessions it may have already rolled to tomorrow. Skill templates (`.claude/commands/sod.md`, `eod.md`, `progress.md`) and upstream `unfoldingWord/uw-dev-skills` codify: use the user's local date from system prompt `currentDate`; for multiple sessions on one local day, append `(morning)` / `(afternoon)` / `(evening)` / `(late-evening)` sub-headings rather than duplicate top-level date headings.

Notable decisions made 2026-05-11 (late-evening):

- **Cross-repo deletion sequencing.** When the portal retires a feature whose backing data is consumed by the worker, the safe sequence is: (1) verify pre-flight KV inventory of the storage namespace, (2) file a PR-ready issue in the worker repo with a migration patch sketch + crosslink, (3) wait for the worker to stop consuming + soak, (4) only then delete the portal-side editing surface. Deleting the portal surface first strands the storage as un-editable hidden state still influencing chat. Codified via the portal #125 ↔ bt-servant-worker#215 pair.
- **`invalidateUserSessions` helper is the canonical session-invalidation policy.** Lives in `worker/auth.ts`. Paginates `session:*`, filters by stored email, optionally skips a session id, and **awaits all deletes before returning**. Used by both `handleChangePassword` (self-change) and `updateUser` (admin reset). Replaces the prior fire-and-forget pattern in `handleChangePassword` where `deletePromises` were never awaited — Cloudflare Workers don't guarantee unawaited promises complete after the response.
- **`AdminScope.org` carries `selfSessionId`.** So password-change branches can preserve the caller's own cookie when the admin happens to be resetting their own password via the browser path. Captured at auth time in `requireAdminAuth` via the now-exported `getSessionId`. X-Admin-Secret CLI has no caller session by design.
- **`Closes #N` fires regardless of prose qualifier.** GitHub auto-closes on any `Closes #N` keyword in a PR body, even if the surrounding prose says "only partially" or similar. Combined with the earlier "Closes is non-list-aware" finding: if a PR shouldn't auto-close an issue, **omit the keyword entirely** — use "Tracks #N" or "Related to #N" instead.
- **Scope = admin-portal only across the bt-servant family.** Coding duties for the bt-servant family are scoped to bt-servant-admin-portal. When cross-repo changes are needed (worker, engine, etc.), file a PR-ready issue with crosslinks in the sibling repo — don't switch directories and author the PR there. Ian handles cross-repo execution. Encoded as memory `feedback_scope_admin_portal_only`.
